## Content Summary
### 1. Introudunction
#### Two meanings of korean evidential -te
- -te conveys the direct evidential meaning that the speaker witnessed the event.
- sentences like (1a) imply abstract concepts regarding the speaker's attitude such as 'psychological distance', 'weakened reliability', 'lack of responsibility'
	- these are unexpected since direct evidentiality indicates the speaker's witness and should convey that the proposition in question is more reliable and trustworthy and hence feels certain about it. (Willet 1988)
> The issue of this paoer: How can two aspects of meaning conveyed by -te sentences be reconciled?
- In Korean evidentials, the speaker relates the speaker's association to the information without believing or making a commitment to it. 
	- in formal terms: a Korean evidential sentence (direct or indirect) does not express an assertive speech act but rather a presentative speech act, in the sense of Faller (2002).

### 2. Evidentials in Korean
- Different types of evidentials in Korean

### 3. Non-assertive Korean evidentials
- Korean evidential sentences (direct or indirect) are not assertive and that the speaker of an evidential sentence simply seves as a channel through which the proposition is obtained and delivered to the hearer. 

#### 3.1 Restrictions on matrix verbs

#### 3.2 Condition on -te sentences

### 4. Faller's (2002) Presentive Speech Act
- Faller(2002)'s  analysis of Quechua evidentials, particularly her analysis of the reportative form -si as a presentative speech act operator.

### 5. An analysis of Korean evidentials
- Argue that what crucially distinguishes evidential sentences from non-evidential sentences in Korean is a presentative speech act. 
	- Present a new sincierity condition for the presentative speech act for Korean evidential sentences.

### 6. Conclusion
- I have argued that a presentative speech act is what crucially distinguishes evidential sentences from non-evidentail sentences in Korean. 
	- The role of the speaker differs between the two types of sentences: the speaker serves as an active judgment-maker in regular sentences but as a passive channel through which the proposition is obtained and delivered to the hearer in evidential sentences. 
	- Korean evidential do two things:
		1. Convey an evidential meaning: the source of information that the speaker acquires. 
		2. Express the non-assertive mode: a presentive speech act. 
- Evidential and non-evidential sentences differ in terms of the evaluation world - while the latter use the actual world, the former use the speaker's perceptual world. 
	- Further consequence: the perfect suffix -exx => (3a) are modal sentences, while non-evidential sentences like (3b) are non-modal (factive) sentences.

#### Why Korean evidential sentences are not assertive?
- Evidential sentences make use of subjective evidence only, whereas non-evidential sentences make use of subjective and/or objective evidence. 
	- Lyons(1977): subjective/ objective modality distinction
	- Nuyts (2001): The notion of subjectivity and objectivity should be defined as a dimension of evidence.
- Korean speakers use evidential sentences to be relieved of the burden of full-responsibility for the claim made on subjective evidence alone.
