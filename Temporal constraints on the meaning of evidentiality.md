## Abstract

> Unlike evidential sentences in languages that have previously been formally analyzed , e.g. Cuzco Quechua and Cheyenne, Korean evidential sentences with _–te_ are compatible with ==both direct and indirect evidence types.== 

In this paper, 
- I analyze _–te_ as an evidential that lexically encodes the meaning of a ‘sensory observation’. 
- I account for the availability of both direct and indirect evidential readings in terms of the variable temporal relation between relevant eventualities. 
	- I show that this temporal relation is compositionally determined by the interaction between _–te_ and tense, and that it in turn constrains possible (direct vs. indirect) evidence types. 
- I also 
	- provide empirical evidence for the ==modal meaning contributions of _–te_ sentences==, and 
	- develop a formal analysis in terms of Kratzer’s modal theory. 
- The paper concludes by discussing the empirical and theoretical improvements of the proposed analysis over earlier analyses by ==Chung==, and the implications for crosslinguistic studies of evidentials.

This section motivates a modal analysis of _–te_ by showing parallel behavior between _–te_ sentences and English epistemically modalized sentences (see, e.g., Izvorski 1997; Matthewson et al. 2007; McCready and Ogata 2007 for a modal analysis of evidentials from other languages). I also take into consideration empirical patterns observed for other languages, and discuss their similarities to and differences from those observed for _–te_ sentences.

## 5. Formal analysis
### 5.1 The framework and assumptions
### 5.2 ==The meaning of the Korean evidential -te==
- The Korean evidential -te has a temporal and an evidential meaning 
	 1. it locates an evidence acquisition time prior to the utterance time
	 2. the agent makes a sensory observation and takes it as evidence for his/her inference of the existence of a described eventuality.
 - On the basis of the empirical evidence presented in Sect. 4, I argue that the evidential _–te_ encodes a modal meaning. As will be discussed later, this modal analysis provides a straightforward explanation of the fact that a _–te_ sentence does not entail the truth of the prejacent in the actual world.
 - I analyze the meaning of _–te_ as a ==necessity modal== within possible worlds seman- tics. This view is supported by examples like (43); they are constructed on the basis of examples in Matthewson et al. (2007) (their (83) and (85)). The contexts in (43) support the existential interpretation.
### 5.3 Interpretation of Korean evidential sentences with -te
## 6. ==Comparison with Chung's (2005, 2007, 2010) analysis==
### 6.1 Ambiguity analysis
Chung argues that -te is not an evidential, but rather a 'spatial deictic past tense that provides a vantage point for evidentials'

##### Cetral Claim in Chung(2005, 2007): Ambiguity 
 −∅, _–ess_, and _–kyess_, which have been analyzed as tense or a modal element in the literature, are evidentials if they occur with _–te_. 
 - −∅ as a direct evidential, and 
 - _–ess_ and _–kyess_ as indirect evidentials. 
 - Thus, the spatiotemporal (non-)overlap between the speaker and a described eventuality in (14), which is represented with the _P-trace_ and the _e-trace_, is specified in the lexical entries of _–_∅, _–ess_, and _–kyess_, as shown in the last conjuncts in (51).
	 - They also encode _L_ ⊆ _v-trace_(_e_), which indicates that the speaker’s spatiotemporal location is included in that of the evidence of a described eventuality. (The variable _L_ denotes a set of time–space coordinates, and the evidence trace function (_v-trace_) maps an eventuality (_e_) to the time–space coordinates ⟨_t_, _l_⟩ of its evidence, as defined in (52)).
 > However, due to the absence of evidential readings without _–te_, Chung argues that −∅, _–ess_, and _–kyess_ are _ambiguous_; (i) they are evidentials if they occur with _–te_, but (ii) they are not evidentials if they do not occur with _–te_.

##### Lee's assessment:
1. This ambiguity analysis is neither independently motivated nor empirically cor- rect.
2. The analysis proposed Lee's paper does not assume ambiguous meanings of the expressions −∅, _–ess_, and _–kyess_. Lee analyze them as encoding a temporal meaning (as tense), whether they occur with _–te_ or not; see their lexical entries in (38).
> Chung’s ambiguity analysis is motivated by her typological assumption (repeated here from (2)) that one evidential marker gives rise to one evidential reading about (in)directness:
> >But this assumption is not supported by crosslinguistic studies. According to Aikhenvald (2004), one of the widespread evidential systems is the A3-system, which involves two evidentials: (i) a reportative evidential, and (ii) an evidential that covers every other evidence type.
> > - Tibeto-Burman languages, languages of South America, South Arawak languages (Ignaciano, Waurá, Pareci, Piro), and North Arawak languages (Resígaro).23 In such a two-fold evidential system, the distinction between direct evidence vs. inferential evidence is not marked by separate morphemes.

> All of these observations suggest that Chung’s assumption about typology in (53) does not hold crosslinguistically.
#### 6.2 Spatial meaning?
###### 54 a b
- 거기는 아까 비가 오더라
- (#) 여기는 지금 비가 오더라
###### 55 a b
- 거기는 어제 비가 오더라
- 여기는 어제 비가 오더라
###### 56 a b
- 거기는 지금 비가 오더라
- 여기는 지금 비가 오더라

##### Lee's analysis
The minimal pair in (55) illustrates that a present tense _–te_ sentence is felicitous with a past-time-denoting adverbial, whatever locative adverbial it occurs with. In contrast, as illustrated in (56), a present tense _–te_ sentence is not felicitous with the utterance time-denoting adverbial _cikum_ ‘now’, whatever locative adverbial it occurs with.

> Spatial references do not affect the felicity of evidential sen- tences with _–te_. Therefore, the example in (54b) is infelicitous due to the occurrence of the time adverbial _cikum_ ‘now’.

###### 57 a b
- (#)지금 밖에는 비가 오고 있더라
- 지금 밖에는 비가 오더라

Chung attributes the above contrast to the spatial meaning of _–te_. She argues that the locative adverbial _pakk-ey_ ‘outside-loc’ does not improve the ungrammaticality of (57a) because a spatial reference is not required for non-evidential sentences like (57a). In contrast, (57b) is grammatical because _–te_ encodes a spatial reference compatible with the adverbial _pakk-ey_ ‘outside’.

However, the examples in (57) do not truly illustrate Chung’s claim about spatiality. The two sentences in (57) have different grammaticality for a separate reason, namely the presence of _cikum_ ‘now’. The time adverbial _cikum_ has the so-called ‘extended now’ meaning; (i) it refers to an utterance time, but (ii) it can also denote a recent past. Both (57a) and (57b) are infelicitous when _cikum_ refers to the utterance time, e.g. in a context where the speaker sees it raining now.26 However, with its recent past meaning, there is a contrast between _–te_ sentences like (57b) and non-evidential sentences like (57a), as illustrated below:

###### 58
- Context: The speaker saw on TV that it was raining in Hawaii. Five minutes later, he got a call from his friend who lives in Hawaii. The speaker said to his friend:
- 거기는 지금 비가 오더라

###### 59
- Context: When Yenghi arrived, Chelswu was not at home. Now, Chelswu’s wife says:
- (#) 철수가 지금 떠났었더라

In (58), the contextually salient time is the time at which the speaker watched TV, i.e. five minutes prior to the utterance time. This recent past time can be constrained by the time adverbial _cikum_ ‘now’, and this temporal meaning is compatible with the _–te_ sentence in (58). In contrast, the recent past meaning of _cikum_ is not compatible with the postverbal morpheme _–essess_ due to its preterit pluperfect meaning (parallel to English past perfect; e.g. Lee 2007). In other words, the contrast between (57a) and (57b) is due to the (in)compatibility of the temporal meaning of _–te_ and _–essess_ with the recent past meaning of _cikum_ ‘now’. The spatial meaning arising from _pakk-ey_ ‘outside’ has nothing to do with this contrast.

#### 6.3 Assertive strength
Chung (2010) argues that Korean evidential sentences express the ‘non-assertive mode’, i.e. uttering _–te_ sentences does not commit the speaker to the truth of the prejacent.

However, Chung’s view that Korean evidential sentences perform a non-assertive (presentative) speech act poses a problem with the empirical data in Sect. 4.2. First, if the speaker is “neutral about his (her) attitude toward or belief in the proposition” (Chung 2010, p. 944) with _–te_ sentences, then it is predicted that the continuations in (25) are felicitous, contrary to the facts

*
My modal analysis also faces a problem with the non-embeddability of _–te_ under _mit-_ ‘believe’ and _sayngkakha-_ ‘think’. I leave this for future studies, since it requires a more thorough investigation of embedded constructions with _–te_ generally.
