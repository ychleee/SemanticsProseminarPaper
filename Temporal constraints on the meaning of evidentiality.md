## 1. Introduction

## 2. Evidentiality: direct vs. indirect evidence types
### 2.1 Compatibility with direct evidence
### 2.2 Compatibility with indirect evidence
### 2.3 Interim summary: -te is evidential
## 3. Temporal constraints on possible evidence types
### 3.1 Expressing (in)directness in natural language: a crosslinguistic perspective
Data:: 10) When the time reference of an evidential category is different from that of the proposition with which it occurs, the resulting evidential value will be nonex- periential. (Woodbury 1986, p. 196)

Data:: 11) Faller(2004)'s

Data:: 12) Faller(2004's)'s analysis of -sqa

Data:: 14) Chung(2007):  a) Direct evidential: e-trace(e)$\cap$ P-trace($s_c$) $\neq$ ø |  b) Indirect evidential: e-trace(e) $\cap$ P-trace($s_c$) = ø
- Building on this line of analysis, I argue that the ==(in)directness meaning in Korean evidential sentences is expressed by means of temporal relations between the evidence acquisition eventuality and the described eventuality.== When the two eventualities are sequentially ordered, direct evidence is not available, but instead (inferential) indirect evidence is available. In contrast, a temporal overlap between the two eventualities does allow for direct evidence.
### 3.2 Relative tense in Korean and their interactions with -te
Data:: 15a) 영희는 비가 온다고 말하였다.
Data:: 15b) 영희는 비가 왔다고 말하였다.
Data:: 15c) 영희는 비가 오겠다고 말하였다.
- With respect to the notion of reference time (Reichenbach 1947), i.e. the time that an utterance is _about_, we assume that tenses are responsible for the temporal location of this reference time. The embedded tenses in (15) locate the reference time of the rain- ing eventuality with respect to that of the saying eventuality: the reference time of the raining eventuality is located (i) at the same time as that of the saying eventuality with present tense, as in (15a), (ii) prior to that of the saying eventuality with past tense, as in (15b), and (iii) after that of the saying eventuality with future tense, as in (15c).
- Korean evidential sentences with _–te_ receive their temporal interpretation in the same fashion as do embedding constructions with past tense in their matrix clauses. This is because the evidential _–te_ itself encodes a temporal meaning: it locates the evidence acquisition time prior to the utterance time.

Data:: 16a) 비가 왔더라
Data:: 16b) 비가 오더라
Data:: 16c) 비가 오겠더라
- The above sentences all describe a raining eventuality, but its temporal location differs. Consider now when each of (16a)–(16c) can be uttered felicitously. Each context in Table 2 reflects a possible temporal relation between (i) the evidence acquisition time (evi) and the utterance time (utt), and (ii) the evidence acquisition time (evi) and the reference time of a described eventuality (des). ≺ and ◦ represent a temporally sequential relation and a temporal overlap, respectively.

### 3.3 Temporal (non-)overlap and (in)direct evidential readings

> [!note] Thesis
>>  I argue that the temporal relation between a described eventuality and an evidence acquisition eventuality, which results from the interactions between _–te_ and tenses, is responsible for the evidential reading of (in)directness.

- Whether the evidence acquisition time overlaps with the reference time of the described eventuality affects the availability of a direct evidential reading. 
	- Their temporal overlap allows for the speaker to perceive the described eventuality itself, 
	- whereas their temporal non-overlap does not. 
	- If the two times are sequentially ordered with past and future tenses, direct evidence is not available, as illustrated in (7) and (8). In contrast, present tense allows the two times to coincide, which results in the availability of direct evidence, as illustrated in (3).

> [!note] The unavailability of a direct evidential reading in examples like (9) with present tense
>> though seemingly puzzling, can also be accounted for along this line. 
>> - This is because the Korean present tense can give rise to a futurate temporal reading in some restricted cases involving a scheduled eventuality (Yoon 1996; Song 1999; among oth- ers), as illustrated in (18).

## 4. Supporting evidence for a modal analysis of the meaning of -te sentences
  
>[!note] Motivation for a modal analysis of -te
>>Parallel behavior between _–te_ sentences and English epistemically modalized sentences (see, e.g., Izvorski 1997; Matthewson et al. 2007; McCready and Ogata 2007 for a modal analysis of evidentials from other languages). 
>>- I also take into consideration empirical patterns observed for other languages, and discuss their similarities to and differences from those observed for _–te_ sentences.

### 4.1 Non-equi subject constraint
>[!note] Non-equi subject constraint
>> the subject of a _–te_ sentence with present tense cannot be the speaker, as exemplified in (19)
- This constraint is also imposed in English modal sentences. 

Data:: 19) 메리/#내가 테니스를 치더라
Data:: 20) Mary/#I must be playing tennis now. 
-  A speaker expresses less certainty with a modal statement than an unmodal statement (e.g. Karttunen 1972; Groenendijk and Stokhof 1975; Kratzer 1991). So in most situations, in order to be maximally infor- mative, he/she would need to assert a fact about himself/herself, instead of making a weak statement with modals.

Data:: 21) 잠을 깨니 내가 영희집 앞에 있더라.
- context:  Last night Chelswu was drunk and fell asleep. When he woke up, he realized that he was in front of Yenghi’s house. Now, he says:
Data:: 22) 내가 나도 모르게 영화를 보면서 울고있더라.
- context: Chelswu watched a very touching movie yesterday. Now, he says:
Data:: 23) I must be on the way home now.
- Context: Chelswu got drunk and fell asleep. When he woke up, he realized that he was in his wife’s car. He said, looking at his wife:
The above examples are reminiscent of Aikhenvald’s (2004) discussion of the ‘first person effect’ with evidentials, from a crosslinguistic perspective. She argues that if direct or inferential evidentials occur with a first person participant, then the partici- pant’s (speaker’s) action is construed as “non-intentional, non-volitional, and generally lacking in control or awareness of what is happening” (Aikhenvald 2004, p. 220)
### 4.2 Anchoring patterns
>[!note] the anchoring pattern of the modal/evidential implication.
>> Previous researchers have utilized this test to motivate a (non-)modal analysis of evidentials across languages (Faller 2002; Matthewson et al. 2007; among others).

First, in unembedded declaratives, both _–te_ sentences and English epistemically modalized sentences are infelicitous when followed by assertion of the negation of the prejacent implication, as illustrated in (24) and (25).

Data:: 24) It must have rained yesterday. # But it did not rain yesterday.
Data:: 25a) 어제 비가 오더라. # 그런데 어제 비가 안왔어.
Data:: 25b) 어제 비가 왔더라 # 그런데 어제 비가 안왔어. 
Data:: 25c) 오늘 밤에 비가 오겠더라. # 그런데 오늘 밤에 비가 안오겠어. 
- By uttering an English sentence with the necessity modal _must_ like (24), the speaker expresses a high degree of certainty about the truth of the prejacent in the actual world. Thus, the continuation with which the speaker asserts the negation of the prejacent is infelicitous. The same pattern observed for Korean in (25) can be explained if we analyze the evidential _–te_ as encoding the modal meaning
- While the modal and evidential implications are anchored to the speaker in simple declarative sentences, they are anchored to the matrix clause subject when the epi- stemic modal _must_ or the evidential _–te_ are embedded under verbs of saying.21 
- Due to this anchoring pattern, the same continuations which were infelicitous in (24) and (25a) are felicitous in (26) and (27): the prejacent in the embedded clause is asserted by the matrix clause subject, and thus the continuation with which the speaker asserts the negation of the prejacent is not infelicitous.

Data:: 26) John said that it must have rained yesterday. But it did not rain yesterday.
Data:: 27) 철수는 비가 어제 오더라고 말하였어. 근데 비가 안왔어. 

>[!note] Thesis
>>I take this parallel anchoring pattern between the English epistemic modal _must_ and the Korean evidential _–te_, in both unembedded and embedded declaratives, to support a modal analysis of _–te_ sentences.
### 4.3 Modal subordination

> [!modal subordination phenomena]
> >Anaphrocic dependency: A non-modal sentence is asserted to be true in the actual world, but ==the prejacent of a modal one is not.== This prevents the anaphor _He_ occurring in the non-modal second sentence in (30a) from referring back to the preceding nominal expression _a thief_ in the modal sentence. 

Data:: 30a) A thief$_i$ might break into the house. # He$_i$ took/takes the silver.
Data:: 30b) A thief$_i$ might break into the house. He$_i$ would take the silver.

- A non-modal sentence is asserted to be true in the actual world, but ==the prejacent of a modal one is not.== This prevents the anaphor _He_ occurring in the non-modal second sentence in (30a) from referring back to the preceding nominal expression _a thief_ in the modal sentence. By contrast, such an anaphoric dependency is possible if the second sentence is modal, as illustrated in (30b).
- Korean evidential sentences with _–te_ exhibit exactly the same contrast, as shown in (31a) and (31b).

Data:: (context for 31 and 32) When Chelswu got home yesterday, he found his room messy with his belongings scattered on the floor. He found a small window in the bathroom left open. Now, he says:

Data:: 31a) 도둑이 들었더라. # ==그는 욕실 창문으로 들어왔다.==
Data:: 31b) 도둑이 들었더. 그는 욕실 창문으로 들어 왔음에 틀림었다.
- In (31), given the sensory evidence (i.e. his room being messy and the window being open), the speaker hypothesized that a thief broke in, but he did not commit himself to the truth of the prejacent in the actual world. This uncertainty on the part of the speaker blocks anaphoric dependency unless the following sentence is modalized.
Data:: 32) 도둑이 들었더. 그는 욕실 창문으로 들어왔더라. 
- The anaphoric dependency between _ku_ ‘he’ and _totwuk_ ‘thief’ in (32) is made possible because the prejacents of both sentences are asserted to be true in some worlds other than the actual world.
## 5. Formal analysis
### 5.1 The framework and assumptions
### 5.2 ==The meaning of the Korean evidential -te==
- The Korean evidential -te has a temporal and an evidential meaning 
	 1. it locates an evidence acquisition time prior to the utterance time
	 2. the agent makes a sensory observation and takes it as evidence for his/her inference of the existence of a described eventuality.
 - On the basis of the empirical evidence presented in Sect. 4, I argue that the evidential _–te_ encodes a modal meaning. As will be discussed later, this modal analysis provides a straightforward explanation of the fact that a _–te_ sentence does not entail the truth of the prejacent in the actual world.
>[!note] Argument for modal analysis of -te-
 >- I analyze the meaning of _–te_ as a ==necessity modal== within possible worlds semantics. This view is supported by examples like (43); they are constructed on the basis of examples in Matthewson et al. (2007) (their (83) and (85)). The contexts in (43) support the existential interpretation.
 
Data:: 43a) (Context: When the speaker got home, he could not find Chelswu’s bag. He was not sure whether Chelswu had left, but he thought that maybe he had.)  # 철수가 떠났더라. 그런데 그가 안떠났을 수도 있어.
Data:: 43b) (Context: The speaker was not sure whether it was Chelswu who had stolen his watch, but he thought that maybe it was.) # 철수가 내시계를 훔치었더라.

- The examples in (43) are infelicitous in the given contexts, which support an existen- tial interpretation. They are felicitous, however, if uttered in a context that supports a universal interpretation, e.g. (43b) is felicitous in a context where the speaker is certain that it was Chelswu who stole his watch. On the basis of this observation, I analyze the evidential _–te_ as involving universal quantification over accessible worlds.
#### a modal analysis of _–te_ sentences grounded in Kratzer’s theory
>[!info]- Kratzer's modal system
> In Kratzer’s modal system, there are two conversational backgrounds which determine the accessible worlds for a modal sentence, i.e. a modal base and an ordering source (Kratzer 1977, 1981, 1991). 
> - Modal Base: 실제 상정하는 Actual world에서의 참인 상황들을 모아놓은 집합.
> - Ordering Source: 어떤 상황들이 어떠한 순서로 더 개연성 있게 일어나는지를 순위 매겨서 나열. 

> [!note] Proposal
> I propose that the relevant conversational backgrounds for Korean evidential sentences with _–te_ are the modal base $SO_{agent}$(Sensory Observation) and the ordering source $ST/DX_{agent}$ (Stereotypical/Doxastic).
> >Both $SO_{agent}$ and $ST/DX_{agent}$ are functions from world-time pairs to sets of propositions, and they are relativized to an agent who by default is the speaker and in certain contexts can be the addressee (in interrogatives) or the agent of an attitude (when embedded under verbs of saying). For simplicity, I henceforth eliminate the subscript _agent_ from the two conversational backgrounds $SO_{agent}$ and $ST/DX_{agent}$.

For each world _w_ and time _t_ , SO(_w_, _t_ ) is the set of propositions _p_ such that the agent has sensory evidence for _p_ at _t_ in _w_, e.g. SO(_w_, _t_) = {_p_1, _p_2}. Assuming that a propo- sition is a set of possible worlds, suppose p_1 = {w_1, w_2, w_3}, _p_2 = {w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4}. Then SO(w_, _t_ ), which is the conjunction of all the propositions for which the agent has sensory evidence at _t_ in _w_, is a set of worlds in which all the propositions in $SO(w,t)$are true, e.g.$SO(w,t) = \{ p_1\cap p_2\}$ = {{$w_1,w_2,w_3$}∩{$w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4$}} = {$w_1, w_2, w_3$}.

However, the modal base SO by itself does not restrict the accessible worlds sufficiently. For example, suppose the context described in (44), where the agent acquired visual and auditory evidence.

Data:: 44) (Context: Yenghi woke up from the sound of water dripping early in the morning. She was still in bed, but saw through a small window that water was falling to the ground. Now, she says) 비가 오더라.

Data:: 49a) 비가 오더라 (I made a sensory observation that) it waas raining => $[$ t′′ ≺ now ∧ ∀w′$[$w′ ∈ BEST(SO, ST/DX, $w^∗$, $t^{′′}$)  → (==t′′ ≼ t′==∧ ∃e$[$**rain**′(_w_′)(_e_)∧τ(_e_,_w_′)⊆t′]$)$]]$
Data::  49b) 비가 왔더라. (I inferred that) it had rained => $[$ t′′ ≺ now ∧ ∀w′$[$w′ ∈ BEST(SO, ST/DX, $w^∗$, $t^{′′}$)  → (==_t_′ ≺ t′′==∧ ∃e$[$**rain**′(_w_′)(_e_)∧τ(_e_,_w_′)⊆t′]$)$]]
Data:: 49c) 비가 오겠더라. (I inferred that) it woud rain =>  $[$ t′′ ≺ now ∧ ∀w′$[$w′ ∈ BEST(SO, ST/DX, $w^∗$, $t^{′′}$)  → (==t_′′ ≺t′==∧ ∃e$[$**rain**′(_w_′)(_e_)∧τ(_e_,_w_′)⊆t′]$)$]]

- The two variables in (49), _t_′′ (for the evidence acquisition time) and _t_′ (for the refer- ence time of the raining eventuality), are not existentially bound. The exact temporal locations of the two time intervals are contextually given, as discussed above.
### 5.3 Interpretation of Korean evidential sentences with -te

> [!note] In this section, 
>> I discuss whether the final representations in (49) make correct predictions about the empirical patterns discussed earlier: 
>> - (i) correlations between the temporal interpretations and the evidential readings about (in)directness (Sect. 3), and 
>> - (ii) the modal meaning contributions of _–te_ sentences (Sect. 4).
## 6. ==Comparison with Chung's (2005, 2007, 2010) analysis==
### 6.1 Ambiguity analysis
Chung argues that -te is not an evidential, but rather a 'spatial deictic past tense that provides a vantage point for evidentials'

##### Cetral Claim in Chung(2005, 2007): Ambiguity 
 −∅, _–ess_, and _–kyess_, which have been analyzed as tense or a modal element in the literature, are evidentials if they occur with _–te_. 
 - −∅ : a direct evidential
 - _–ess_ and _–kyess_: indirect evidentials. 
 - Thus, the spatiotemporal (non-)overlap between the speaker and a described eventuality in (14), which is represented with the _P-trace_ and the _e-trace_, is specified in the lexical entries of _–_∅, _–ess_, and _–kyess_, as shown in the last conjuncts in (51).
	 - They also encode _L_ ⊆ _v-trace_(_e_), which indicates that the speaker’s spatiotemporal location is included in that of the evidence of a described eventuality. (The variable _L_ denotes a set of time–space coordinates, and the evidence trace function (_v-trace_) maps an eventuality (_e_) to the time–space coordinates ⟨_t_, _l_⟩ of its evidence, as defined in (52)).
 > However, due to the absence of evidential readings without _–te_, Chung argues that −∅, _–ess_, and _–kyess_ are _ambiguous_; (i) they are evidentials if they occur with _–te_, but (ii) they are not evidentials if they do not occur with _–te_.

##### Lee's assessment of Chung's ambiguity analysis:
1. This ambiguity analysis is neither independently motivated nor empirically correct.
2. The analysis proposed Lee's paper does not assume ambiguous meanings of the expressions −∅, _–ess_, and _–kyess_. Lee analyze them as encoding a temporal meaning (as tense), whether they occur with _–te_ or not; see their lexical entries in (38).
> Chung’s ambiguity analysis is motivated by her typological assumption (repeated here from (2)) that one evidential marker gives rise to one evidential reading about (in)directness:
> >But this assumption is not supported by crosslinguistic studies. According to Aikhenvald (2004), one of the widespread evidential systems is the A3-system, which involves two evidentials: (i) a reportative evidential, and (ii) an evidential that covers every other evidence type.
> > - Tibeto-Burman languages, languages of South America, South Arawak languages (Ignaciano, Waurá, Pareci, Piro), and North Arawak languages (Resígaro). In such a two-fold evidential system, the distinction between direct evidence vs. inferential evidence is not marked by separate morphemes.

> All of these observations suggest that Chung’s assumption about typology in (53) does not hold crosslinguistically.
#### 6.2 Spatial meaning?
###### 54 a b
- 거기는 아까 비가 오더라
- (#) 여기는 지금 비가 오더라
###### 55 a b
- 거기는 어제 비가 오더라
- 여기는 어제 비가 오더라
###### 56 a b
- (#) 거기는 지금 비가 오더라
- (#) 여기는 지금 비가 오더라

##### Lee's analysis
The minimal pair in (55) illustrates that a present tense _–te_ sentence is felicitous with a past-time-denoting adverbial, whatever locative adverbial it occurs with. In contrast, as illustrated in (56), a present tense _–te_ sentence is not felicitous with the utterance time-denoting adverbial _cikum_ ‘now’, whatever locative adverbial it occurs with.

> Spatial references do not affect the felicity of evidential sen- tences with _–te_. Therefore, the example in (54b) is infelicitous due to the occurrence of the time adverbial _cikum_ ‘now’.

###### 57 a b
- (#)지금 밖에는 비가 오고 있었다
- 지금 밖에는 비가 오더라

Chung attributes the above contrast to the spatial meaning of _–te_. She argues that the locative adverbial _pakk-ey_ ‘outside-loc’ does not improve the ungrammaticality of (57a) because a spatial reference is not required for non-evidential sentences like (57a). In contrast, (57b) is grammatical because _–te_ encodes a spatial reference compatible with the adverbial _pakk-ey_ ‘outside’.

However, the examples in (57) do not truly illustrate Chung’s claim about spatiality. The two sentences in (57) have different grammaticality for a separate reason, namely the presence of _cikum_ ‘now’. The time adverbial _cikum_ has the so-called ‘extended now’ meaning; (i) it refers to an utterance time, but (ii) it can also denote a recent past. Both (57a) and (57b) are infelicitous when _cikum_ refers to the utterance time, e.g. in a context where the speaker sees it raining now.26 However, with its recent past meaning, there is a contrast between _–te_ sentences like (57b) and non-evidential sentences like (57a), as illustrated below:

###### 58
- Context: The speaker saw on TV that it was raining in Hawaii. Five minutes later, he got a call from his friend who lives in Hawaii. The speaker said to his friend:
- 거기는 지금 비가 오더라

###### 59
- Context: When Yenghi arrived, Chelswu was not at home. Now, Chelswu’s wife says:
- (#) 철수가 지금 떠났었더라

In (58), the contextually salient time is the time at which the speaker watched TV, i.e. five minutes prior to the utterance time. This recent past time can be constrained by the time adverbial _cikum_ ‘now’, and this temporal meaning is compatible with the _–te_ sentence in (58). In contrast, the recent past meaning of _cikum_ is not compatible with the postverbal morpheme _–essess_ due to its preterit pluperfect meaning (parallel to English past perfect; e.g. Lee 2007). In other words, the contrast between (57a) and (57b) is due to the (in)compatibility of the temporal meaning of _–te_ and _–essess_ with the recent past meaning of _cikum_ ‘now’. The spatial meaning arising from _pakk-ey_ ‘outside’ has nothing to do with this contrast.

#### 6.3 Assertive strength
Chung (2010) argues that Korean evidential sentences express the ‘non-assertive mode’, i.e. uttering _–te_ sentences does not commit the speaker to the truth of the prejacent.

However, Chung’s view that Korean evidential sentences perform a non-assertive (presentative) speech act poses a problem with the empirical data in Sect. 4.2. First, if the speaker is “neutral about his (her) attitude toward or belief in the proposition” (Chung 2010, p. 944) with _–te_ sentences, then it is predicted that the continuations in (25) are felicitous, contrary to the facts

*
My modal analysis also faces a problem with the non-embeddability of _–te_ under _mit-_ ‘believe’ and _sayngkakha-_ ‘think’. I leave this for future studies, since it requires a more thorough investigation of embedded constructions with _–te_ generally.
