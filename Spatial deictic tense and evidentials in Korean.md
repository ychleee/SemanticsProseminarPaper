# Content Summary
## Abstract
This paper focuses on the Korean suffix -te, which has been variously analyzed as a marker of tense, aspect, tense–aspect, mood, mood–tense, or evidentiality. I argue against all of these approaches and propose instead that -te is a spatial deictic past tense^[deixis: 'pointing to' expression typical example is demonstrative.], which triggers an evidential environment. It refers to a certain past time when the speaker either observed an event or some evidence of the event within his (her) perceptual field. Thus, the denotation of -te is ‘overlap’, not between the speaker’s perceptual field and the event itself, but between the speaker’s perceptual field and the evidence of the event at the past reference time. To account for this denotation, I propose an ‘evidence trace’ function as well as a ‘speaker’s perceptual trace’ function (cf. M. Faller, J Semantics 21:45–85, 2004). My analysis shows that suffixes like -ess (which is traditionally analyzed as a perfect) play two roles, as an indirect evidential and a perfect, depending on whether they appear with the spatial deictic tense -te or with a simple deictic tense. I argue that in Korean two distinct tense systems—the regular tense–aspect system and the spatial deictic tense–evidential system—exist in parallel. Thus the proposed analysis allows evidentials to be subsumed under the formal theory of tense, aspect, and mood.

## Introduction
### Cinque and Sohn's definition of -te as evidential
Sohn claims that a sentence with -te must describe a situation that the speaker witnessed directly, as illustrated in (2).

### Paper Structure 
- Section2: possibility of -te as an evidential. I argue that -te provides both a direct evidential meaning and an indirect evidential meaning, rulling out an account that relies soley on the notion of direct evidentiality.
- Section 3: the notion of 'speaker's perceptual field' and spatial deictic tense, as developed by Faller(2004)
	- these notions are relevant to the suffix -te, defined as spatial deictic past tense.
	- -ess, -keyss, a morphologically zero form are true evidentials, which are manifested as a regular aspect or mood in the absence of a spatial deictic tense.
- Section 4: Suffix -ney is the present tense counterpart of the spatial deictic past tense -te, both of them trigger evidential environments.
- Section 5: Universial Hierachy functional projections. 
## 2. Evidential approaches
### 2.1 Constraints on -te
#### Speaker's Personal Obeservation Contraint
- according to Suh (1977, 1996, p. 328), a sentence with -te must express a situation that the speaker observed
- Sohn (1994), as mentioned before (see (2)), also claims that a sentence with -te must describe a situation that the speaker wit- nessed
#### Equi-Subject Constraint
- the subject of a sentence with -te must be the speaker, 
- It only applies to sensory or psych predicates, such as oylop ‘be lonely’ or coh ‘be good’ (or ‘like’), as shown in (5) and (6):
###### 5 a b
Data:: 5a) 그때는 내가/나는 외롭더라
	- [I felt] I was lonely at that time.
Data:: 5b)# 그때는 메리가/메리는 외롭더라
	- [I felt] Mary was lonely at that time. 
###### 6 ab
Data:: 6a) 그때는 내가/나는 매리가 좋더라.
	- [I felt] I liked Mary at that time.
Data:: 6b) # 그때는 존이/존은/ 매리가 좋더라.
	- [I felt] John liked Mary at that time.
#### Non-Equi-Subject Constraint
- The subject of the sentence -te cannot be the speaker, 
- It applies to all predicates except for sensory and psych predicates, as illustrated in 7 and 8

###### 7 a b
Data:: 7a) 메리가/는 학교에 가더라
Data:: 7b) 내가/나는 학교에 가더라

###### 8 a b
Data:: 8a) 메리가/메리는 예쁘더라
Data:: 8b) # 내가/나는 예쁘더라

#### Contuer example to these constraints
##### 1. even with sensory or emotional experience predicates, -te is not allowed with the first person, as shown in (9), thus supporting not the Equi-Subject Constraint, but instead the Non-Equi-Subject Constraint.
###### 9 a b
Data:: 9a) # 그때는 내가 몹시 외롭더라
Data:: 9b) # 그때는 내가 메리를 좋아하더라
=> Mood? 
##### 2. -te is allowed when the speaker describes his (her) action or appearance as compared with third persons within the context of a larger group, as illustrated in (10):
###### 10 a b
Data:: 10a) 나혼자만 학교에 가더라
Data:: 10b) 내가 제일 예쁘더라
These elements indicate that the speaker is part of a larger situation observed by the speaker.
- I show below that all the constraints and counterexamples mentioned above can be handled by reference to the notions of the speaker’s perceptual field and the passive perceiver
#### conclusion: -te as a direct evidential marker
1. it requires something like the Speaker’s Personal Observation constraint, that is, a sentence with -te must express a situation that the speaker witnessed.
2. evidentials often exhibit a person restriction.
### 2.2 Is -te a direct evidential?
>Cinque (1999), following Sohn (1994), has defined the Korean suffix -te in main clauses as an evidential marker.
>>I argue against the hypothesis that -te is a direct evidential marker.

#### Givon's hierachies of evidential strrength based on cross lingusitic data:
###### 11. Hierachies of evidential strength
Data 11a):: Access hierachy: Direct sensory expereince > Inference > Hearsay
Data 11b):: Sensory sub-heirachy: Vison > Hearing > Other => The higher the term is on the hierarchies in (11), the more likely it will be unmarked semantically and morphologically.
#### Problems of applying Givon's hierarchy to Korean -te
- Although the presence of -te may indicate direct evidence, the absence of -te does not guarantee indirect evidence.
	- there is no strict division into direct vs. indirect evidence with respect to the occurrence of -te.
- when -te co-occurs with other aspect or mood suffixes, the sentence expresses a speaker’s inference, which is not a direct evidential meaning, but rather an indirect evidential meaning.
	- a sentence with the perfect form -ess as well as -te does not express the meaning of direct evidence (that is, the speaker’s witnessing of the event) but rather the speaker’s inference based on the result state at a specific time, as illustrated in (12a)
###### 12
Data:: 12a) 매리가 거울을 깼더라
- [I inferred/found] out Mary broke the mirror.
Data:: 12b) 내가 가겠더라
- [I inferred] I would go.

>In the absence of other aspect and mood markers such as -ess and -keyss: 
>>-te indicates a direct evidential meaning


>In the presence of -ess or -keyss:
>>-te expresses an indirect evidential meaning, that is, the speaker’s inference of the event

>[!note] Argument: -te itself is not an evidential
>> The very purpose of an evidential system is to distinguish direct and indirect evidence, and thus it is unlikely that both direct evidence and indirect evidence are expressed by the same morpheme. 

## 3. The spatial dictic tense -te
It denotes a certain past time when the speaker either perceived a given event itself or some indirect evidence of the event.
### 3.1 Speaker's perceptual field and spatial diectic tense

### 3.2 The speaker of -te is a passive perceiver [go](x-devonthink-item://7E3E81AF-FFB4-4244-8BE9-58F2E8165C42?page=10)
###### Perceptual field
- a physical space that the speaker has perceptual access to, where perception may involve any of the senses, not just sights. 
- It excludes locations that are within the perceptual range of the speaker but did not receive his (her) attention at the reference time. 
	- a constraint like the Speaker’s Personal Observation Constraint is automatically accounted for by the notion of the speaker’s perception.
###### The notion of speaker's perception implies that the speaker is a passive perceiver.
- as long as your five senses are intact, you perceive things unintentionally; thus we can say that perception is more of a passive cognitive behavior than a voluntary action.
#### Argue: the speaker of a sentence with -te should be a passive perceiver, not an active participant of the situation described by the sentence
- when the speaker of a sentence with -te is not an active participant, the sentence is acceptable even if the speaker is the subject of the sentence.
##### 1. -te is allowed when the subjective is a non a-gentive experiencer[go](x-devonthink-item://7E3E81AF-FFB4-4244-8BE9-58F2E8165C42?page=11)
###### (16)a, b
Data:: 16a) 내가 눈물이 나더라
	- [I noticed] I had tears coming out / out of my eyes.
Data:: 16b) # 내가 울더라
	- [I noticed] I was crying
##### 2. -te is allowed with a first person subject when the subject is not an agent of a sensory predicate. 
###### 17a, 17b
Data:: 17a) 내가 /나는 피아노 소리가 들리더라
	- [I noticed] I heard a piano
Data:: 17b) # 내가/ 나는 피아노 소리를 듣더라
	- [I noticed] I heard a piano at that time.
##### 3. With Psych predicates, -te exhibits the same contrast, as seen in (6a) and (9b), repeated below. 
The predicate in (6a) is not agentive and thus the first person subject is not an agent, and the sentence is acceptable. In contrast, the predicate in (9b) is agentive, as evidenced by the accusative-marked argument. Thus the subject is an agent and the sentence is unacceptable.
###### 6a, 9b
Data:: 6a/9b) 그때는 내가 메리가 좋더라 / # 그때는 내가 매리를 좋아하더라

###### 5a, 9a
Data:: 5a/9a) 그때는 내가 외롭더라 / # 그때는 내가 몹시 외로워 하더라. 
	- [I noticed] I was lonely at that time.
	- [I noticed] I was feeling/felt terribly lonely at that time.

Korean has two types of psych predicates: bare psych predicates such as (5a) and -eha psych predicates such as (9a), which are derived from the bare psych predicates.
- derived -eha psych predicates can license accusative case making and thus denote the activity of ‘doing’ or ‘behaving’ one’s emotion.
-  Assuming Kim’s analysis is correct, we can consistently predict when a first person subject is allowed: ==a first person is allowed in a sentence with -te if and only if the first person is not an agent of the event described by the sentence.==
##### However, the notion of the thematic role agent is still not sufficient to account for all the data with -te. Rather, the notion of ‘active participant’ is required.

[[#8 a b|8b]]: ??내가/나는 예쁘더라
	- [I saw] I was pretty
- -te is allowed when the speaker describes his (her) action or appearance within the context of a larger group, regardless of the agentivity of the subject.
- even sentences like [[#7 a b|7b]] become acceptable when they are used to describe the speaker’s action as if it were somebody else’s.

##### -te is allowed even if the speaker is the agent of the event as long as the action is unconscious or involuntary.
###### 18
Data:: 18) 나도 모르게 (내가) 그의 집으로 가더라.
	- [I noticed] I walking toward his house without knowing it / unconsciously. 
- 18 sugests that the speaker suddenly realized (perceived) what (s)he was doing, although (s)he is the person who was doing the action. In other words, (s)he is not consciously or voluntarily involved in the event.
###### 19 Perception condition on -te
Data:: 19) The speaker of a -te sentence cannot be an active participant but ==should be a passive perceiver of a given situation.==
	- This notion of passive perceiver is derived from the notion of the speaker’s perceptual field because, as mentioned above, perception is more of a passive cognitive behavior than a voluntary action.
>  Furthermore, I argue that ==the term passive perceiver should be understood in relation to evidentiality.==

###### cf: Accusative/ unaccusative
- Accusative: 타동사(transtiive)
- (자동사)intranstive
	- Unaccusative: 비대격동사(주어가 있지만, 그 주어가 Agent가 아님. 어떤 것의 효과를 겪는 experiencer인데, 걔가 목적어일수가 없어서 주어자리에 온것이다.)
		- He came to my house 'come' ??
			- He went to my house. 
		- 내가 눈물이 나오더라 '나오'
		- telic, or dynamic change of state or location. 
	- Unergative: 비능격동사(순수자동사 => '일부러' 같은 부사어를 첨가해서 이벤트를 꾸며줄 수 있는지 테스트. 에이전트후드를 판별할 수 있음. 할 수 있으면 순수 자동사) => PASSIVIZATION 됨.
		- 내가 울더라 '울'
	- test:
		- 'intentionally + '
		- 'passivization'?

### 3.3-Te is a spatial deictic tense[go](x-devonthink-item://7E3E81AF-FFB4-4244-8BE9-58F2E8165C42?page=14)
###### 20
Data:: 20) 지금 밖에는 비가 오고 있었었다.
###### 21
Data:: 21) 지금 밖에는 비가 오더라
###### 22
Data:: 22a) 메리가 거울을 깨더라
Data:: 22b) 거울을 깼더라
Data:: 22c) 거울을 깼겠더라

22a: Speaker witnessed the event, implying that the event occurred within the speaker's perceptual field
22b/22c: Speaker did not witness the event of Mary's breaking the mirror, indicating that it occurred outside of the speaker's perceptual field. 
	-te: the event time is not necessarily restricted with respect to the speaker's perceptual field. 
	Thus, the denotiona of -te cannot be defined by the relation between the speaker's perceptual field and the event in question.

The sentences in (22) indicate the different types of evidence with respect to a given event at the past time:
- (22a) indicates the speaker’s witnessing of the event at the reference time
- (22b) with -ess indicates that the speaker inferred the event based on evidence at the reference time; 
- (22c) with -keyss indicates that the speaker inferred the event based on his (her) reasoning at the reference time.

According to Anderson (1986, p. 274), an evidential shows the kind of justification for a factual claim which is available to the speaker: whether the claim is made based on (i) direct evidence plus observation (no inference needed), (ii) evidence plus inference, (iii) inference (evidence unspecified), or (iv) reasoned expectation from logic and other facts.
What these sentences have in common is that they all express some evidence of the event in question at the past reference time.
> [!note] Therefore, 
> >I argue that for -te, the evidence of an event, whether it is direct or indirect, relates to the speaker’s perceptual field:
> >>te conveys that the evidence is within the speaker’s perceptual field.

- The event itself is indirectly related to the speaker’s perceptual field via -ess and -keyss.
	- As observed in (22a), in the absence of other aspect and mood markers, a sentence with -te conveys that the speaker witnessed the event under consideration,
	- whereas in the presence of those markers, the sentence conveys that the speaker infers the event based on the result state and his (her) reasoning.
- My analysis of these facts leads me to suggest another spatiotemporal trace function, the evidence trace function (v-trace), as in (23a), in addition to Faller’s (2004) notion of speaker’s perceptual trace in (14b), rewritten as (23b).

###### 23 a, b
Data:: 23a) v-trace(e) = $At(v,t,l)$ is true iff the evidence v for the occurrence of the eventuality e appears at a location l at time t.
Data:: 23b) $Perceive (s_c, t, l)$ is true iff the speaker s_c perceives location l at time t. 
> Claim: -te refers to a certain past time when the speaker perceives the evidence of the event, i.e., the time when the speaker's perceptual trace, P-trace(s_c), overlaps the evidence trace, v-trace(e).
- Thus the past time serves as a deictic vantage point (‘there and then’) for evidentials and is a ‘temporally and spatially shifted here and now’
	- the meaning of the past time reference and the overlap between the speaker’s perceptual trace and the evidence trace are indeed the presuppositions of -te.


###### 24 
Data:: 24) 메리가 거울을 안깼더라

###### 25
- It is the case that at the contextually salient past time t, I perceived that there was no prior event such that Mary breaks the mirror.
	- NOT: It is not that case that at the contextually salient past time t, I perceived that there was a prior event such that Mary breaks the window.

Thus, -te is a deictic tense but it differs from regular deictic tenses in that it requires reference not only to time but also to space, i.e. the speaker’s per- ceptual field.

### 3.4 Evidentials in Korean [go](x-devonthink-item://7E3E81AF-FFB4-4244-8BE9-58F2E8165C42?page=17)

I have suggested that the evi- dential meanings come from other suffixes, such as -ess and -keyss.
## 4. -ney is the spatial deictic present tense
## 5. Conclusions and implications
>[!note] Conclusion
>>-te is a spatial deictic past tense that induces an evidential environment.
>>- te is neither a past imperfective, nor an evidential, 
- Spatial tense fucntions to set the stage for the evidentaial distinction (i.e. direct vs inferential indirect evidentials)
- but the type of evidentiality itself is systematically determined by the preceding morpheme, not by -te.

>[!Note] Spatial deictic tesne that induces an evidential environment. 
>- present: -ney
>- past: -te

### Korean has two disctinct types of deictic tenses
1. Simple deictic tenses:
	1.  Do not havespatial reference hence no evidential meanings. 
2. spatial deictic tenses: 
	1. necessarily require reference to spatial location or the speaker's perceptual field. 
	2. indicates that the speaker's location is restricted to a certain place at the reference time, which induces different types of evidentials. 
		1. If it occurs within the speaker's perceptual field: The direct evidential meaning is induced.
		2. If it occurs outside of the speaker's field, indirect evidential meaning is induced. 
### Korean data have shown that the same morphemes manifest different roles in different environments.
- ess, kyess, ø
	- functions as either evidentials or non evidentials, depending on whether they occur with a simple dictic tense or a spatial diectic tense. 
### Korean has two distinct tense systems: the regular tense-aspect system and the spatial deictic tense-evidential systmem [go](x-devonthink-item://7E3E81AF-FFB4-4244-8BE9-58F2E8165C42?page=27)
