# Abstract


In this paper, we propose a new understanding of the Korean "-te-" marker in assertive sentences. Our perspective differs from previous studies by Lee (2010, 2013) and Lim (2010), who suggest that "-te-" is an evidential marker. Instead, we align with Chung's (2007) argument that "-te-" is a spatio-temporal deictic marker that signifies the perspective on which the assertion is based. However, we diverge from Chung's view by denying that morphemes such as "-ass-," "-kyess-," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences.

We argue that in Korean -te- assertive sentences, there is no evidential morpheme that marks  [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#^71d4a3|propositional-level eventuality]]^[Faller (2004), "The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua"], which is a relation between speaker and the proposition. Instead, we propose that the propositional-level evidentiality of -te- assertions comes from conversational implicature of plain assertion. In our account, -te- assertive sentences are understood as plain assertion whose evidential vintage point is marked. As it is already a version of plain assertion, it already has propositional level evidentiality of assertive sentences. Therefore, -te- sentences do not need an additional marker for propositional-level evidentiality. The role of "-te-" is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion's evidence is based on.

We will demonstrate that our account can comprehensively explain the data presented in Lee, Lim, and Chung's studies and does not encounter the problems their accounts faced.

In this paper, we propose a new understanding of the Korean "-te-" marker in assertive sentences. Our perspective diverges from previous studies by Lee (2010, 2013) and Lim (2010), who suggest that "-te-" is an evidential marker. Instead, we align with Chung's (2007) argument that "-te-" is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies the perspective on which the assertion is based. However, we differentiate from Chung by denying that morphemes such as "-ass-," "-kyess-," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences. We will argue that in Korean -te- assertive sentences, there is no evidential morpheme that marks [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#^71d4a3|propositional level eventuality]]^[Faller (2004), "The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua"], which is a relation between speaker and the proposition. We will argue that this propositional-level evidentiality of -te- assertions comes from [[Supplementary Material for Semantics Term Paper#Plain assertion is the strongest assertion.|conversational implicature ]] of assertive sentences. So, -te- sentences do not need additional marker for propositional-level evidentiality. The role of "-te-" is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion's evidence is based on.
We will show that our account can comprehensively explain the datas presented in Lee, Lim and Chung and does not meet the problems their accounts faced. 

, and the requirement for evidence in "-te-" sentences is that of the plain assertion made from the specified vantage point. We will argue that our account will comprehensively explain the all the datas that -te-.

###### Ingredients. 

- By Conversational Implicature, Plain assertion without any hedging markers alrady has/exhibits propositional-level evidentiality. It directly asserts the state without any hedging markers. 
	- The (evidential) relation between speaker and the proposition must be very strong. The speaker must have the strongest type of evidence (direct evidence) in order to say a plain assertion. 
- What does -te- do? It specifies a perspective/vantage point on which the plain assertion is based on. 


C:: The intuitive idea behind it, 

Plain assertion without any additional morphemes(markers/ intuitively, 'hedging' markers) already has the strongest requirement for evidentiaity. In order to say plain assertive sentences, the speaker ias required to have the strongest type of evidences. In this sense, propositional level eventuality is already inherent in plain assertion. 

In asserting -te- assertions, we assert that an event obains (is true), and we are basing our that assertion on 'observation' we made at the vantage point 

> We propose to understand -te- assertive sentences as assertive sentences whose 

The assertion with "-te-" is simply a plain assertion based on a specific vantage point made salient by the "-te-" marker. Therefore, it already possesses the requirement for evidentiality inherent in plain assertions, and does not require any additional marker for evidentiality. 

"비가 왔다."  /"비가 오더라." =>

###### Draft
In this paper, we present a novel account of the function of the Korean morpheme "-te-"  in assertive sentences. Our approach diverges from previous studies Lee (2010, 2013), and Lim (2010), who argue that there are ""-te-evidential marker in korean "-te-" sentences. Instead, we propose that 
"-te-" is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies the perspective from which the assertion is based. We argue that the requirement for evidentiality is already inherent in the plain assertion, and that the addition of "-te-" does not add any additional evidential requirement. Our positive account is that "-te-" serves to specify the vantage point on which the assertion is based, rather than adding any evidential requirement. We also reject the idea that morphemes such as "ass," "kyess," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences.

In this paper, we present a novel account of the function of the Korean "-te-" marker in assertive sentences. Our approach diverges from previous studies by Lee (2010, 2013), and Lim (2010), who argue that "-te-" functions as an evidential marker. Instead, we follow Chung who argues that "-te-" is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies the perspective from which the assertion is based. However, our approach differs from Chung in that we reject the idea that morphemes such as "ass," "kyess," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences.
We argue that -te- sentence is a version of the plain assertion. Assertion with '-te-' is just the plain assertion whose evidence is based on specific vantage point that is made salient by '-te-.' So, it has the requirement for evidentiality that is already inherent in the plain assertion. Thus it does not need any additional marker for the requirement of evidence.   "-te-"'s role is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion is based, and the requirement for the evidence for the '-te-' sentence is that of the plain assertion made on the vantage point. 

rather than adding any evidential requirement. We also reject the idea that morphemes such as "ass," "kyess," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences.
###### Ingredients
In this paper, we review Chung (2007) and Lee (2010, 2013) and Lim (2010)'s account of Korean -te- sentences. And we will present a different account about '-te-' sentences and their evidentiality. We will follow Chung (2007), in arguing that -te- is not an evidential marker. But we will present a different account from Chung (2007) in that we will argue that Korean assertive sentences with '-te-' do not need an additional 'evidential marker' to add requirement for evidentiality.
We will also argue that -te- is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies a perspective that assertion's evidence is based on, following chung (2007), but will deny that morphemes like 'ass,' 'kyess,' ø are evidential markers in -te- sentences. 
Our positive account is that -te- sentences do not need evidential marker that signifies the evidence requirement, because it inherits the strongest requirement for evidence from the plain assertion. 
-te-: plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on. 


on which the assertion's evidence is based on. 
So, sentences with -te- has evidential requirements (the speaker of the sentence must have an appropriate evidence in order to felicitously speak that sentence), but this requirement does not come from any morphemes or evidential markers. Instead we will argue that it comes from the assertion itself. To make aplain assertion without any morphemes, we already must have a very good evidence. 

##### Plain assertion is the strongest assertion. 
- Kartoonnen's puzzle shows that it is at least more stronger than necessity epistemic modal.

### Griciean Maxim of Quality
One should assert things only when one has appropriate evidence.

###### GMQ'(Gricean Maxim of Quality'): An assertion's strength should match the evidence's strength. (The assertion's strength must be proportional to one's evidence's strength. )
- In order to assert more strongly, one needs stronger evidence.

By Gricean Maxim of quality, and the fact that plain assetion is the strongest, plain assertion requires the strongest evidence.


-te-: plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on.

# Introduction: Evidential and Korean Morpheme '-te'
# Overview of previous accounts
## [[Spatial deictic tense and evidentials in Korean|Chung]]'s account
### account
1. '더' is not evidential morpheme, but '었', '겠', $\emptyset$ is evidential morpheme. 
	1. argument?: Ambiguity thesis
2. '더' is a spatio-temporal 지시사. 
### critique
1. Quoting [[Temporal constraints on the meaning of evidentiality#Lee's assessment of Chung's ambiguity analysis:|Lee (2013)]]: Chung's acccount is neither independently motivated nor empirically correct. 
	1. Chung's typological assumption is not empirically supported.
2. There are other ways to explain this ambiguity phenomena. Such as Lee's.

## [[Temporal constraints on the meaning of evidentiality|Lee]]'s account
### account
1. '더' marks sensory evidence.
	1. there are lingering problems: 
2. '더' expresses necessary modal
### critique

#### 1. '더' expressing necessary epistemic modal?  
 1) 비가 오고 있었다.
 2) 비가 오더라.
 3) 비가 오고 있던 게 분명해./비가 오고 있었다고 확신해/분명히 생각해. (as epistemic modal) // (나는 비오는 걸 본 게) 확실해. (meta-discourse)
 - 3)보다 2)가 강하다. 3)은 직접 보지 못했다는 뉘앙스가 있음. It cannot be equated with epistemic modal. 
#### 2. '더' sentence isn't restricted to sensory cases.
- 그때 욕심이 나더라. 
- 그때 생각 나더라. 
#### 3. The meanign of '더' cannot be reduced to certainty. 
1. 그때 내가 좋은 생각이 났다. (fellicitous)
2. 그때 내가 계획을 짜고 있더라. (infellicitous)
- 1, 2 has no difference in terms of certainty. They are both certain to the speaker. But 1 is acceptable while 2 is not. We need some other criterion.
- evidentiality of '더' is not reducible to degree of certainty (contra Lee)


-   -te- is a direct evidential marker. Its indirect meaning comes from the temporal constraints
#### Clarification:  Why Lee's understanding of 'sensory perception' is problematic:
- 뉴스 보고 '오바마 오더라'라고 말하는 경우
	- Is this the case of sensory perception? 
	- Surely, it involves senseory perception in the process, because we actually watched 
## [[Korean Evidential -te- Inference from Direct Evidence|Lim 2012]]'s account
### account

### critique

## Comparsion and assessment
- Desiderata for '-te' sentences
	1. direct evidence
# Our Account: '더' as marking *observation* : "It was observed by the speaker/hearer"
> 더 sentences and normal sentences isn't differentiated in terms of requirement of evidences
## the meaning of '더': ("It(the event) was observed (by the speaker) )that"
- the meaning of '네': "It is observed that"
### Observation here means direct perception, or something near enough
#### In paradigm cases, Observation means direct perception(sensory perception is the paradigm case of observation)
###### Case 1
1. 아까 비가 오더라.
	- (It was observed (by the speaker)) that it rained then.
2.  아까 비가 왔다.
	- It rained then.
- 1 requires direct direct sensory perception. 

#### Observation isn't restricted to sensory observation (Contra Lee)
1. 그때는 욕심이 나더라. 
2. 그때 좋은 생각이 났다. 
#### Observation Can't be determined by degree of certainty 
1. 그때 내가 좋은 생각이 났다. (felicitous)
2. # 그때 내가 계획을 짜고 있더라. (infelicitous)
- 1, 2 has no difference in terms of certainty. They are both certain to the speaker. But 1 is acceptable while 2 is not. We need some other criterion.
- evidentiality of '더' is not reducible to degree of certainty (contra Lee)

#### Something Near enough: Two hypothesis: 
>1. Best possible evidendence hypothesis
> >One can use '더' if one had best possible evidence available at EAT.
> >해당 맥락에서 가장 강한 증거. 

> 2. Extended observation hypothesis 
> > One can use '더' if one observed the event (including 'extended' sense of observation) at EAT.
> > - Extended observation? ==perceived through highly credible source. ==

##### Testing the hypothesis
###### Case 2: Evidence change (Weather Forecast)
- 맥락: 오늘(10일) 오전에 내일(11일) 비가 온다는 일기예보를 보고, 점심을 먹다가 상대방에게 내일 날씨에 대해서 얘기하는 상황. 
1. 내일 아침에 비가 오더라. (felicitous)
	- (It was observed (by the speaker)) that it will rain tommorow morning .
2. 내일 아침에 비와. (felicitous)
	1. It will rain tommorow morning.
- 맥락: 11일 오후가 되었음. 늦잠자고 일어남. 실내에 있었기 때문에 비가 온 것은 관찰하지 못함. 그 상태에서 옆 사람에게 아침 날씨에 대해 얘기하는 상황. 
3. 아까 아침에 비가 오더라.  (Infelicitous)
4. 아까 아침에 비 온 것 같던데. (Infellicitous)
5. 아까 아침에 비 온 것 같아. (Infellicitious)
6. 아까 아침에 비 왔을지도 몰라. (Fellicitous)

>Question: Why is 3,4,5 infellicitous? while 6 is fellicitous?
- Evidence based on weather forcast became a fairly weak evidence on 11. So, it is only compatible with very weak form of assertion such as 6.
- What had been considered as 'direct observation or something near enough' at one context 

###### Case 3: Evidence change (News) 
> Best Evidence Hypothesis: One can use '더' if one had best possible evidence available 
- 맥락: 내일(11일) 오전에 바이든이 서울에 온다는 뉴스를 오늘(10일) 오전에 들었고, 오늘(10일) 점심을 먹다가 동료에게 얘기하는 상황.
7. 내일 바이든이 서울에 와. (felicitous)
	- (It is observed (by the speaker)) that Biden will come to Seoul tommorow.
8. 내일 바이든이 서울에 오더라. (felicitous)
	1. Biden will come to Seoul tommorow. 
- 맥락: 11일 저녁이 되었음. 실제로 바이든이 왔는지는 보지 못했음. 동료에게 얘기하는 상황. 
9. 바이든 서울 왔더라. (infellicitous)
10. 바이든 서울 왔어. (==infellicitous?==)
- 맥락: 조금 다른 상황. 11일 오후에 바이든이 무사히 서울에 도착했다는 뉴스를 보았음. 동료에게 얘기하는 상황. 
11. 바이든 서울 서울 왔더라. (felicitous)
12. 바이든 서울 왔어. (felicitous)
> Question: why 9, 10 is infellicitous while 7 and 8 is fellicitous?
> > Best possible evidence available hypothesis can explain this case. 

> Question: Why 11 and 12 is fellicitous while 9 and 10 is infellicitous? 
> > "Best possible evidence available hypothesis" fails here. 
### The difference between 1 and 2
1. 비가왔다.
	- It rained.
2. 비가오더라. 
	- (It was observed (by the speaker) that) it rained.
> The difference between 1 and 2: 


## What can be observed and what cannot be observed: Anscomb
- how do we understand 'perspective'
	- The first person case
- How this proposal differs from previous accounts
	- Chung's
	- Lee's
	- Lim's
- How this proposal meets desiderata for '-te' 

## Evidentiality of '더'
> [!note] There is no difference between '더' sentence and plain assertion in terms of requirement for direct evidence.
> > 'perspective' can. 
- It is true that 더' sentences require evidence. The strongest evidence available for the speaker. 
	- However, it is not because '더' marks some special sort of 'evidential meaning' or 'requirement of evidence,' but because assertion itself requires evidence. '더' sentences are also assertions.
-  Does sentences with '더' requires an additional evidence? Is there an additional requirement for evidence in '더' sentences? In these cases, both sentences require the strongest evidence(in this case, direct evidence). So, requirement of evidence caannot distinguish two sentences. 
	- But, these sentences differ in their meanings. 
	-   그런데, ‘관점성'으로는 가능함. 
	-   희중: Chung의 여러 예시들 (5,6,7,8) ‘더'를 쓴 문장들에서 ‘더'를 빼고 말해도 이상하지 않음. 
	-   두 경우 모두 발화하려면 직접 증거를 요구한다는 점에서는 동일하다. (같은 증거 상황에서 발화 가능) 
	-   하지만, 두 발화는 다르다. 어떤점에서? ‘더'가 들어가면 관점성이 개입해서 hedging이 이뤄진다. 
	-   선생-제자 대화 예시에서, 선생의 전문분야(권위가 선생한테있는)에 대해서 제자가 ‘A더라구요.’ 라고 하는것은 Acceptable한 여지가 있지만, (자신이 이런저런 관찰을 했다는 뉘앙스가 있음) 하지만 ‘A에요.' 라고 plain assertion을 하는 것은 무리가 있다.
