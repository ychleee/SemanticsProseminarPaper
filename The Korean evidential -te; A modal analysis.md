This paper formally analyzed the evidential readings of Korean sentences realized with –te. Unlike languages with typologically common evidential systems, Korean does not employ distinct evidentials for distinct sources of information conveyed. However, the evidence types available with –te sentences are predicted by its interactions with tem- poral categories. This provides a new perspective in cross-linguistic studies of eviden- tiality; an evidential meaning is not necessarily marked by independent morphemes, but it can be expressed by interactions with other grammatical categories.

Furthermore, I discussed why a modal approach to the evidential –te is necessary, and developed a compositional analysis in terms of Kratzer’s modal theory. The re- lation of evidentiality and modality is cross-linguistically varied, too. Some previous studies argued for a modal meaning of evidentials (e.g. Izvorski 1997 for Bulgarian, Turkish and Norwegian; McCready and Ogata 2007 for Japanese; Matthewson et al. 2008 for St’át’imcets), and others argued against it (e.g. Faller 2002 for Quechua). This paper does not make a claim for language universals on the relationship of evidential- ity and modality. But the crucial point made in this paper is that a modal analysis of –te is necessitated in order to capture our inference processes on the basis of evidence. In particular, the two core notions in Kratzer’s system, a modal base and an ordering source, are crucial to formalize the process of our evaluating evidence (in the sense of de H! aan 1999) and making a claim on the basis of it. This view differs from de Haan’s view on evidentials as “asserting that there’s evidence for the speaker’s utterance but does not interpret the evidence in any way (de Haan 1999)”. More cross-linguistic data needs to be taken into consideration to make further remarks on the relationship of evidentiality and modality, but this paper presented one case study of the Korean evi- dential –te as a modal with empirical evidence and a compositional analysis.
