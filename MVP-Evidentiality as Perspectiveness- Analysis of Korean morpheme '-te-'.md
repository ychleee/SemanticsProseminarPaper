# Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new account of the so-called evidential *-te-* in Korean assertions. Our perspective differs from previous studies by Lee (2010, 2013) and Lim (2010), who suggest that *-te-* is an evidential marker. Instead, we align with Chung's (2007) argument that *-te-* is a (spatio-)temporal deictic tense that signifies the perspective on which the assertion is based. However, we diverge from Chung's view by denying that (tense) morphemes such as *-ass-*, *-keyss-* and ø-morpheme are evidential markers in *-te-* sentences.
C:: Hee: What does it mean to "signify"? If *-te-* is a tense marker, can it "signify perspectives"?

We argue that in Korean *-te-* assertive sentences, there is no evidential morpheme that marks  [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#^71d4a3|propositional-level evidentiality]]^[Faller (2004), "The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua"], which is a relation between the speaker and the proposition. Instead, we propose that the propositional-level evidentiality of *-te-* assertions comes from conversational implicature of plain assertions. In our account, *-te-* assertions are understood as plain assertions whose evidential vantage point is marked. By virtue of being a version of plain assertion, it already has a propositional-level evidentiality of assertions. Therefore, *-te-* sentences do not require an additional marker for propositional-level evidentiality. The role of *-te-* is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion's evidence is based.

We will demonstrate that our account can comprehensively explain the data presented in Lee, Lim, and Chung's studies and does not encounter the problems each of their accounts faced.

###### Draft
In this paper, we propose a new understanding of the Korean "-te-" marker in assertive sentences. Our perspective diverges from previous studies by Lee (2010, 2013) and Lim (2010), who suggest that "-te-" is an evidential marker. Instead, we align with Chung's (2007) argument that "-te-" is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies the perspective on which the assertion is based. However, we differentiate from Chung by denying that morphemes such as "-ass-," "-kyess-," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences. We will argue that in Korean -te- assertive sentences, there is no evidential morpheme that marks [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#^71d4a3|propositional level eventuality]]^[Faller (2004), "The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua"], which is a relation between speaker and the proposition. We will argue that this propositional-level evidentiality of -te- assertions comes from [[Supplementary Material for Semantics Term Paper#Plain assertion is the strongest assertion.|conversational implicature ]] of assertive sentences. So, -te- sentences do not need additional marker for propositional-level evidentiality. The role of "-te-" is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion's evidence is based on.
We will show that our account can comprehensively explain the datas presented in Lee, Lim and Chung and does not meet the problems their accounts faced. 

, and the requirement for evidence in "-te-" sentences is that of the plain assertion made from the specified vantage point. We will argue that our account will comprehensively explain the all the datas that -te-.

###### Ingredients. 
- By Conversational Implicature, Plain assertion without any hedging markers alrady has/exhibits propositional-level evidentiality. It directly asserts the state without any hedging markers. 
	- The (evidential) relation between speaker and the proposition must be very strong. The speaker must have the strongest type of evidence (direct evidence) in order to say a plain assertion. 
- What does -te- do? It specifies a perspective/vantage point on which the plain assertion is based on. 


C:: The intuitive idea behind it, 

Plain assertion without any additional morphemes(markers/ intuitively, 'hedging' markers) already has the strongest requirement for evidentiality. In order to say plain assertive sentences, the speaker is required to have the strongest type of evidences. In this sense, propositional level eventuality is already inherent in plain assertion. 

**In asserting with *-te-*, we assert that an event obains (is true)**, and we are basing our/that assertion on the 'observation' we made at a given vantage point 

> We propose to understand -te- assertive sentences as assertive sentences whose 

The assertion with *-te-* is simply a plain assertion based on a specific vantage point made salient by the *-te-* marker. Therefore, it already possesses the requirement for evidentiality inherent in plain assertions, and does not require any additional marker for evidentiality.

We argue that -te- sentence is a version of the plain assertion. Assertion with '-te-' is just the plain assertion whose evidence is based on specific vantage point that is made salient by '-te-.' So, it has the requirement for evidentiality that is already inherent in the plain assertion. Thus it does not need any additional marker for the requirement of evidence.   "-te-"'s role is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion is based, and the requirement for the evidence for the '-te-' sentence is that of the plain assertion made on the vantage point.

###### Ingredients: GMQ

In this paper, we review Chung (2007) and Lee (2010, 2013) and Lim (2010)'s account of Korean -te- sentences. And we will present a different account about '-te-' sentences and their evidentiality. We will follow Chung (2007), in arguing that -te- is not an evidential marker. But we will present a different account from Chung (2007) in that we will argue that Korean assertive sentences with '-te-' do not need an additional 'evidential marker' to add requirement for evidentiality.
We will also argue that -te- is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies a perspective that assertion's evidence is based on, following chung (2007), but will deny that morphemes like 'ass,' 'kyess,' ø are evidential markers in -te- sentences. 
Our positive account is that -te- sentences do not need evidential marker that signifies the evidence requirement, because it inherits the strongest requirement for evidence from the plain assertion. 
-te-: plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on. 


on which the assertion's evidence is based on. 
So, sentences with -te- has evidential requirements (the speaker of the sentence must have an appropriate evidence in order to felicitously speak that sentence), but this requirement does not come from any morphemes or evidential markers. Instead we will argue that it comes from the assertion itself. To make aplain assertion without any morphemes, we already must have a very good evidence. 

Plain assertion is the strongest assertion. 
- Kartoonnen's puzzle shows that it is at least more stronger than necessity epistemic modal.

Griciean Maxim of Quality
One should assert things only when one has appropriate evidence.

GMQ'(Gricean Maxim of Quality'): An assertion's strength should match the evidence's strength. (The assertion's strength must be proportional to one's evidence's strength. )
- In order to assert more strongly, one needs stronger evidence.

By Gricean Maxim of quality, and the fact that plain assetion is the strongest, plain assertion requires the strongest evidence.


-te-: plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on.

# 1. Introduction
###### ingredients: first sentence
- Chung 2007: The status of the Korean suffix -te presents an intriguing puzzle and is the source of much controversy in the Korean literature.
- Lee 2013: This paper explores how the meaning of evidentiality is temporally constrained in nat- ural language, through a detailed study of the meaning of Korean evidential sentences.
- Lim 2012: Korean verbal ending -te- introduces different presuppositions depending on whether it appears with a tense marker (such as the past tense marker -ass/ess- or the future tense marker -keyss-) or not.
## 1.1. Evidentiality and Korean *-te-*
Korean verbal ending *-te-* has been analyzed as contributing to the evidentiality of a given assertion in recent formal theoretic studies (cf. [[Spatial deictic tense and evidentials in Korean|Chung, 2007]]; [[Temporal constraints on the meaning of evidentiality|Lee, 2013]]; [[Korean Evidential -te- Inference from Direct Evidence|Lim, 2012]]). In these papers, it has been commonly argued that *-te-* marks that the speaker's direct perception or sensory observation of the evidence for the asserted proposition took place at some past reference time. Following are the common and prototypical examples of the papers mentioned above (directly quoted from Lee, 2013):

\ex. Context: Yenghi saw it raining yesterday. Now, she says:
\gll Pi-ka o-$\emptyset$-te-la.\\
rain-NOM fall-PRES-TE-DEC\\
`[I made a sensory observation that] it was raining.'

Different accounts diverged on how to explain the fact that Korean *-te-* sentences can in principle offer direct or indirect evidence for the proposition asserted. Interactions with tense(-aspect) morphemes^[Although these bold-typed morphemes are often analyzed as PST or FUT, some kind of temporal morpheme. We will argue that *-ass-* is a perfective aspectual marker and *-keyss-* an epistemic modal. These non-tense markers will properly interact with the Evidential Deictic Tense that *-te-* denotes, which is our core assumption.] seemed to decide on which evidence type was available to the speaker.

\ex. Context: Yenghi saw yesterday that the ground was wet. Now, she says:
\gll Pi-ka o-**ass**-te-la.\\
rain-NOM fall-**PST**-TE-DEC\\
`[I inferred (from the acquired sensory evidence) that] it had rained.'

\ex. Context: Yenghi saw the overcast sky yesterday. Now, she says:
\gll Pi-ka o-**keyss**-te-la.\\
rain-NOM fall-**FUT**-TE-DEC\\
`[I inferred (from the acquired sensory evidence) that] it would rain.'

As one can see in (2)-(3), presence of some tense-related morphemes give rise to an inferential interpretation of the *-te-* sentences. In contrast, a zero-morpheme in (1), which is assumed to be a present morpheme in Korean, lets the speaker assert the proproposition based on a direct perception evidence.

From this spectrum of data, Korean *-te-* has often been argued to be an evidential marker (but see Chung, 2007). In the present paper, we will argue that this morpheme is not an evidential marker, at least in the sense that it does not mark any evidence at a propositional level. Korean *-te-* is a marker of perspective, which specifies the vantage point on which the assertion's evidence is based. It will be argued that an assertion's evidence is required independently of evidentials since (evidential-less) plain assertions in Korean cannot be uttered felicitously without strong/appropriate-type-of evidence. As with [[Spatial deictic tense and evidentials in Korean|Chung (2007)]], *-te-* will be treated as a *Evidential Deictic Tense* (similar to *Evidence Acquisition Time* in previous literature on evidentiality).

In the remainder of this introduction, a brief summary of constraints on *-te-* sentences will be offered. Before we could propel this rather unexpected argument, we present an overview of three main previous accounts along with problems each causes in [[MVP-Evidentiality as Perspectiveness- Analysis of Korean morpheme '-te-'#2. Overview of previous accounts|Section 2]]. In [[MVP-Evidentiality as Perspectiveness- Analysis of Korean morpheme '-te-'#3. Our Account: '더' as marking perspective|Section 3]], we provide our account, first by clarifying what *-te-* is not and then showing that while *-te-* is not an evidential, there is evidentiality in assertions in general regardless of evidential markers in Korean. In [[MVP-Evidentiality as Perspectiveness- Analysis of Korean morpheme '-te-'#4. Comparisons with previous accounts|Section 4]], a comparison of our account with previous ones will hopefully show that ours is on the right track. Then, in [[MVP-Evidentiality as Perspectiveness- Analysis of Korean morpheme '-te-'#5. Cross-linguistic implications|Section 5]], a cross-linguistic implication of our argument will be reviewed. [[MVP-Evidentiality as Perspectiveness- Analysis of Korean morpheme '-te-'#6. Conclusion|Section 6]] concludes.

## 1.2. Constraints on *-te-*
Following constraints are commonly assumed in the papers under discussion. We present a summary of each constraint, with the glossing slightly modified for a unified demonstration.

### 1.2.1. Speaker's Personal Observation Constraint
In paradigmatic cases, a sentence with *-te-* must describe a situation that the speaker witnessed (Chung, 2007; a.o.). When there is no perfective aspect (*-ass/ess-*^[These two morphemes are allomorphs. Decision among these two are purely phonological.]) in a *-te-* sentence, sentence (5) is an infelicitous utterance from a speaker who is not a contemporary of Shakespeare. (Chung further supports this constraint by noting that the context where a speaker saw a movie of Shakespeare's biography would save 5. We agree with this observation.)

%%4%%
\ex. 
\gll. ku tangsi mary-ka ce cip-ey sal-te-la.\\
that time Mary-NOM that house-LOC live-TE-DEC\\
`[I saw] Mary was living in that house at that time.’

%%5%%
\ex. 
\gll *ku tangsi shakespeare-ka ce cip-ey sal-te-la.\\
that time Shakespeare-NOM that house-LOC live-TE-DEC\\
(Intended meaning) `[I saw] Shakespeare was living in that house at that time.’

### 1.2.2. Equi-Subject Constraint 
Chung (2007) further explains the well-known (among Korean linguists) constraints on Korean *-te-* sentences: In case of sensory or psych predicates such as *oylop-* (be lonely), *coh-* (like), the subject of a *-te-* sentence must be the speaker.^[Why? because, in [[Anscombe, G. E. M.|anscombe]]'s sense, it is not that we know our actions from our observation. We can make it more precise: in case actions, we cannot use *-te-*, because it is, in some sense, unobservable by us.]

%%6%%
\ex.
\gll ku-ttay(-nun) nay-ka oylop-te-la.\\
that-time(-TOP) I-NOM  be.lonely-TE-DEC\\
`[I felt] I was lonely at that time.’

%%7%%
\ex.
\gll *ku-ttay(-nun) mary-ka oylop-te-la.\\
that-time(-TOP) Mary-NOM be.lonely-TE-DEC\\
(Intended meaning) `[I felt] Mary was lonely at that time.’

%%8%%
\ex.
ku-ttay(-nun) nay-ka mary-ka coh-te-la.\\
that-time-TOP I-NOM Mary-NOM like-TE-DEC\\
`[I felt] I liked Mary at that time.’

%%9%%
\ex.
\gll *ku-ttay(-nun) john-i mary-ka coh-te-la.\\
that-time-TOP John-NOM Mary-NOM like-TE-DEC
(Intended meaning) `[I felt] John liked Mary at that time.’

An additional restriction is that not all sensory or emotional predicates but only unaccusative ones whose subject is an experiencer (and not an agent) follows this constraint. Note that the auxiliary *-eha-*(do) verb in the following sentences changes the acceptability of 1st person subject - sensory/psych predicate association in *-te-* sentences. Sentences (10)-(11) are not completely ungrammatical less infelicitous, but they blatantly sound unnatural in that the speaker is reporting him- or herself's (emotional) actions as if he or she were observing someone else's.

%%10%%
\ex.
\gll ??ku-ttay-nun nay-ka mopsi oylow-**eha**-te-la.\\
that-time-TOP I-NOM awfully be.lonely-do-TE-DEC\\
(Intended meaning) `[I felt] I was terribly lonely at that time.’

%%11%%
\ex.
\gll ??ku-ttay-nun nay-ka mary-lul coh-**aha**-te-la.\\
that-time-TOP I-NOM Mary-ACC like-do-TE-DEC\\
(Intended meaning) `[I felt] I liked Mary at that time.’

### 1.2.3. Non-Equi-Subject Constraint
For all predicates except for sensory and psych predicates, the subject of sentence cannot be the speaker. Predicates such as *ka-* (go) or *yeyppu-* (be.pretty) do not go well with 1st person subject in *-te-* sentences. The unnaturalness of the *-te-* sentences with 1st person subject is the same as sentences (10)-(11).

%%12%%
\ex. 
\gll mary-ka/nun hakkyo-ey ka-te-la.\\
Mary-NOM/TOP school-LOC go-TE-DEC\\
`[I saw] Mary was going to school.’ 

%%13%%
\ex. 
\gll ??nay-ka/na-nun hakkyo-ey ka-te-la.\\
I-NOM/I-TOP school-LOC go-TE-DEC\\
(Intended meaning) `[I saw] I was going to school.’

%%14%%
\ex.
\gll mary-ka/nun yeyppu-te-la.\\
Mary-NOM/TOP be.pretty-TE-DEC\\
`[I saw] Mary was pretty.’  

%%15%%
\ex. 
\gll ??nay-ka/na-nun yeyppu-te-la.\\
I-NOM/I-TOP be.pretty-TE-DEC\\
(Intended meaning) `[I saw] I was pretty.’

### 1.2.4. *-te-* always requires direct perceptual evidence.  
Lim (2012), referring to [[Lee (2010)]], point sout that usage of *-te-* in assertions requires the speaker's direct perception of some eventuality. Take a look at the following example:

%%16%%
\ex. (Scenario: John is sick, so he has stayed in his bed since yesterday and has not been outside at all. John’s room does not have any window, so he could not see outside, either. *Today he heard from his roommate that the ground is wet.* John says to his friend on the phone...) 
\gll \#Ecey pi-ka o-ass-te-la\\
Yesterday rain-NOM fall-PST-te-DECL\\
`[I inferred (from the acquired sensory evidence) that] Yesterday it rained’

However, even in a similar scenario, when the speaker does have some kind of direct perception of the eventuality under consideration, it becomes felicitous to utter a *-te-* utterance:

%%17%%
\ex. (Scenario: Mary was sick, so she stayed in her bed all day long. Her room does not have any window, so she could not see outside at all. *Now she saw that her roommate came home with a wet umbrella and a wet raincoat.* She says to her friend on the phone...)
\gll Onul pakk-ey pi-ka o-te-la.\\
Today outside-LOC rain-NOM fall-te-DECL\\
(Intended meaning) `[I made a sensory observation that] Today it rained outside’

###### More Thinking
- 이게 정확히 무슨 Constraint? Evidence에 대한 Herasay같은것을 제외하려고 하는 것인가? 
=> Here, 'direct perception of evidence' can be misleading. In some sense, we can say that John had directly perceived his evidence, say, his roomates saying that the ground is wet. Why John's case is infellicitous? Because 'hearsay' is not counted as direct perceptive evidence. What if someone says, it involves direct perception of the evidence because it involves direct perception of John's friends' saying? It is a bit wrong because here, 'direct'

 > [!warning] This is misleading

> > So, this says almost nothing. No substantial constraint at all.

# 2. Overview of previous accounts
## 2.1. [[Spatial deictic tense and evidentials in Korean|Chung (2007)]]
As the first formal explanation of the so-called Korean evidential morpheme *-te-*, [[Chung (2007)]] argues that *-te-* is not an evidential morpheme. Instead, the tense morphemes that immediately precede *-te-*, such as *-ass/ess-* (PST), *-keyss-* (FUT) or even a zero-morpheme (PRS) are evidentials in a *-te-* sentence. *-te-* is a spatio-temporal deictic (past) tense in Faller's 2004 sense. 

[[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua|Faller (2004)]] argues that *-sqa* in Cuzco Quechua is a non-experienced past marker, that requires that the eventuality of the prejacent took place outside of the speaker's perceptual field (the time-location coordinate of the speaker's perception). It attaches to verbs, differently from Cuzco Quechua evidentials *-mi*, *-chá*, *-si* (cf. [[Faller (2002)]]) which attach to other constituents, hence it cannot be an evidential but a tense. Adopting this way of thinking, Chung (2007) argues that *-te-* in Korean is equally a spatio-temporal deictic tense, minimally differing in that *-te-* requires that the eventuality under discussion (somehow) took place *inside* the speaker's perceptual field.

According to Chung (2007, Sect. 3.4), simple deictic tense morphemes *-ass/ess-*, *-keyss-* or $\emptyset$ are actually ambiguous between tense and evidentials, the latter of which is only available when the spatio-temporal deictic past tense is marked with *-te-*^[Chung (2007) further shows that this special type of deictic tense has its present counterpart: *-ney*. Although we do not agree with Chung's analysis of whether these morphemes are evidentials or not, our account do align with this temporally parallel analysis of *-te-* and *-ney*.] As evidentials, the overt forms *-ass/ess-* and *-keyss* serve as indirect evidentials (examples 2 and 3), and the covert form ($\emptyset$) serves as a direct evidential (example 1).

Chung's account covers most of the data that we presented in Introduction: direct vs. indirect distinction in prototypical cases (1 vs. 2,3); the (Non-)Equi-Subject Constraints. For non-observable predicates such as *oylop-* (be.lonely), *coh-* (like), the speaker's perceptual field cannot be at someone else's emotional state (hence the Equi-Subject Constraint). In case of observable predicates (and transitive psych predicates with *-eha*), it is plainly redundant to be reporting the observation on oneself resulting in the unnaturalness in examples (10,11,13,15), hence the Non-Equi-Subject Constraint.

However, there are both conceptual and empirical problems to Chung's analysis, both of which are nonnegligible. First, Chung's classification of evidentials cannot explain the data in (17). For the proposition `Today it rained outside', Mary does not have any direct evidence. She only has an indirect (albeit reliable) evidence for raining outside today, which is her perception of a wet umbrella and a wet raincoat. Still, we do not see any (simple tense) morphemes *-ass/ess-* or *-keyss-*, which Chung argue to be indirect evidentials. The relation to the evidence is not predicted based on the presence/absence of these morphemes.

Moreover, as Lee (2013:33-34) criticizes, Chung's ambiguity analysis is only motivated by her typological assumption:

\ex. (...) –te itself is not an evidential. The very purpose of an evidential system is to distinguish direct and indirect evidence, and thus it is unlikely that both direct evidence and indirect evidence are expressed by the same morpheme. (Chung 2007, p. 195)

Cross-linguistically, in one of the widespread two-fold evidential system ([[Aikhenvald (2004)]], A3-system), ``the distinction between direct evidence vs. inferential evidence is not marked by seperate morphemes'' (Lee, 2013:34). Evidentials may code the source of informations, but the (in)directness of the evidence do not have to be encoded lexically in separate morphemes. The example (17) seems to suggest that this is the case in Korean.

- Desiderata for '-te' sentences



## Our account
>[!note] Our account of -te-
>1. -te- is not an evidential morpheme that marks propositional-level evidentiality
>2. -te- assertive sentence is an assertive sentence that asserts an event P is the case. 
>3. '-te-' is a deictic tense that marks the vintage point the event is  asserted 

We argue that in Korean -te- assertive sentences, there is no evidential morpheme that marks  [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#^71d4a3|propositional-level evidentiality]]^[Faller (2004), "The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua"], which is a relation between speaker and the proposition. Instead, we propose that the propositional-level evidentiality of -te- assertions comes from conversational implicature of plain assertions. In our account, -te- assertions are understood as plain assertions whose evidential vantage point is marked. As it is already a version of plain assertion, it already has propositional-level evidentiality of assertive sentences. Therefore, -te- sentences do not need an additional marker for propositional-level evidentiality. The role of "-te-" is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion's evidence is based on.

1. direct evidence
# 3. Our Account: '더' as marking perspective 
## Thesis (1) what *-te-* is not
### -te- is not necessary modal. (Contra Lee)
- Lee (2013) analyzes -te- as a necessity modal. But we argue that it is not. Below is Lee's analysis:
data:: 22 $[[-te]] = \lambda P_{<s,<i,t>>}.\lambda w.\lambda t. \exists t''[t''<t \land \forall w'[w' \in BEST(SO,ST/DX, w, t'') \rightarrow P(w')(t''))]]$

- We argue that the lexical entry in 22 faces difficulty in explaining data like below:
- Context: There was a murder in the neighborhood of John: Bill was murdered by someone. John is a close friend to Bill. He lives the next door and he is one of the officials who investigated the incident. John saw that Bill and Tom fought heavily the day before the murder. (Tom said "I will kill you.") And he saw that Tom buying a gun and bullets right after the fight. What he also saw was Tom going toward the direction to Bill's house on the day of the murder. And by investigating the situation, he found out that the type of bullet that Tom bought the day before the murder was the same kind of bullet that Bill had been shot. The next day of the murder, John talks to his officer friend about the murder.
1. In this situation, John can felicitoulsy assert the necessity epistemic modal: "톰이 빌을 쏜 것이 틀림없어" (It must be the case that Tom shoot Bill.)
2. But, John cannot felicitously assert -te- sentence: "톰이 빌을 쐈더라." ([It is observed by the speaker] Tom shoot Bill.)
3. But by if we follow Lee (2013)'s analysis of *-te-* and take lexical entry of $[[-te-]]$ in 22, John can fellicitously assert that "톰이 빌을 쐈더라."
		- It is because given his sensory observations of evidences(modal base) and stereotypical/doxastic ordering source, the proposition that Tom shoot Bill is true in all epistemic alternative worlds. 
			- We can explain it further like this: 


### - te- is not a morpheme that marks propositional-level evidentiality. 
- Lee and Lim both argue that *-te-* is a morpheme that marks a propositional-level evidentiality, which is a relation between speaker and the proposition. 
- We argue that it is not. We argue that *-te-* is a deictic tense that denotes an EAT (Evience Acquisition Time) that is prior to ST (speech time). and that EAT is an evidential perspective from which the speaker observed (directly perceived) the situation in RT (Reference Time). In other words, it denotes a perspective in a certain past time from which the speaker perceived the situation. 
- There is a propositional-level evidentiality in *-te-* assertive sentences, in that the speaker must have an appropriate level of evidence in order to felicitously assert the *-te-* sentence. But we argue that the evidential element is not what is added by '-te-.' (Or by '-ass-,' 'kyess', ø in )
### the propositional-level evidentiality is already present in assertions without -te-.
- 

## Thesis (2) *-te-* as marking perspective(vantage point) -te- 
- We analyze the meaning of -te- as a deictic tense that denotes an EAT (Evience Acquisition Time) that is prior to speech time. EAT is a perspective from which the assertion of the states of affairs that obtains at RT. In speaking -te- sentences, 1. The speaker asserts that certain states of affairs obtain at RT using -te- sentences. 2. And the speaker conveys a presuppositional meaning that the ground of the assertion is based on certain salinet time in the past (at EAT.) In order to make an assertion, the speaker is required to have appropriate level of evidence proportional to the strength of the assertion. In assertion without -te- this evidence vintage point is not specified. In -te- assertive sentences, that evidence vintage point is specified by -te-. 
- This is similar analysis with Chung (2007), who argues that -te- itself is not an evidential. 

## Thesis (3) -te- sentences as expressing an assertion made from a perspective (EAT). 
- We argue that -te- sentences are assertive sentences made from a perspective (EAT). 
- To illustrate this, we will start with simple cases. We will divide cases into three.
1. 어제 비가 오더라. 
2. 지금 비가 오더라.
3. 내일 비가 오더라. 
- 1 asserts that 

### Time talk
- presupposed meaning of the 'EAT': EAT < ST
- Usual neo-Reichenbachian time ontology: ET <-> RT <-> ST
	- RT is unspecified when aspect is morphologically invisible

- How we differ from Lee or Chung's account

> 더 sentences and normal sentences isn't differentiated in terms of requirement of evidences
### the meaning of '더': ("It(the event) was observed (by the speaker) )that"
- the meaning of '네': "It is observed that"
#### Observation here means direct perception, or something near enough
##### In paradigm cases, Observation means direct perception(sensory perception is the paradigm case of observation)
###### Case 1
1. 아까 비가 오더라.
	- (It was observed (by the speaker)) that it rained then.
2.  아까 비가 왔다.
	- It rained then.
- 1 requires direct direct sensory perception. 

##### Observation isn't restricted to sensory observation (Contra Lee)
1. 그때는 욕심이 나더라. 
2. 그때 좋은 생각이 났다. 
##### Observation Can't be determined by degree of certainty 
1. 그때 내가 좋은 생각이 났다. (felicitous)
2. # 그때 내가 계획을 짜고 있더라. (infelicitous)
- 1, 2 has no difference in terms of certainty. They are both certain to the speaker. But 1 is acceptable while 2 is not. We need some other criterion.
- evidentiality of '더' is not reducible to degree of certainty (contra Lee)

##### Something Near enough: Two hypothesis: 
>1. Best possible evidendence hypothesis
> >One can use '더' if one had best possible evidence available at EAT.
> >해당 맥락에서 가장 강한 증거. 

> 2. Extended observation hypothesis 
> > One can use '더' if one observed the event (including 'extended' sense of observation) at EAT.
> > - Extended observation? ==perceived through highly credible source. ==

##### Testing the hypothesis
###### Case 2: Evidence change (Weather Forecast)
- 맥락: 오늘(10일) 오전에 내일(11일) 비가 온다는 일기예보를 보고, 점심을 먹다가 상대방에게 내일 날씨에 대해서 얘기하는 상황. 
1. 내일 아침에 비가 오더라. (felicitous)
	- (It was observed (by the speaker)) that it will rain tommorow morning .
2. 내일 아침에 비와. (felicitous)
	1. It will rain tommorow morning.
- 맥락: 11일 오후가 되었음. 늦잠자고 일어남. 실내에 있었기 때문에 비가 온 것은 관찰하지 못함. 그 상태에서 옆 사람에게 아침 날씨에 대해 얘기하는 상황. 
3. 아까 아침에 비가 오더라.  (Infelicitous)
4. 아까 아침에 비 온 것 같던데. (Infellicitous)
5. 아까 아침에 비 온 것 같아. (Infellicitious)
6. 아까 아침에 비 왔을지도 몰라. (Fellicitous)

>Question: Why is 3,4,5 infellicitous? while 6 is fellicitous?
- Evidence based on weather forcast became a fairly weak evidence on 11. So, it is only compatible with very weak form of assertion such as 6.
- What had been considered as 'direct observation or something near enough' at one context 

###### Case 3: Evidence change (News) 
> Best Evidence Hypothesis: One can use '더' if one had best possible evidence available 
- 맥락: 내일(11일) 오전에 바이든이 서울에 온다는 뉴스를 오늘(10일) 오전에 들었고, 오늘(10일) 점심을 먹다가 동료에게 얘기하는 상황.
7. 내일 바이든이 서울에 와. (felicitous)
	- (It is observed (by the speaker)) that Biden will come to Seoul tommorow.
8. 내일 바이든이 서울에 오더라. (felicitous)
	1. Biden will come to Seoul tommorow. 
- 맥락: 11일 저녁이 되었음. 실제로 바이든이 왔는지는 보지 못했음. 동료에게 얘기하는 상황. 
9. 바이든 서울 왔더라. (infellicitous)
10. 바이든 서울 왔어. (==infellicitous?==)
- 맥락: 조금 다른 상황. 11일 오후에 바이든이 무사히 서울에 도착했다는 뉴스를 보았음. 동료에게 얘기하는 상황. 
11. 바이든 서울 서울 왔더라. (felicitous)
12. 바이든 서울 왔어. (felicitous)
> Question: why 9, 10 is infellicitous while 7 and 8 is fellicitous?
> > Best possible evidence available hypothesis can explain this case. 

> Question: Why 11 and 12 is fellicitous while 9 and 10 is infellicitous? 
> > "Best possible evidence available hypothesis" fails here. 
##### The difference between 1 and 2
1. 비가왔다.
	- It rained.
2. 비가오더라. 
	- (It was observed (by the speaker) that) it rained.
> The difference between 1 and 2: 


#### What can be observed and what cannot be observed: Anscomb
- how do we understand 'perspective'
	- The first person case
- How this proposal differs from previous accounts
	- Chung's
	- Lee's
	- Lim's
- How this proposal meets desiderata for '-te' 

### Evidentiality of '더'
> [!note] There is no difference between '더' sentence and plain assertion in terms of requirement for direct evidence.
> > 'perspective' can. 
- It is true that 더' sentences require evidence. The strongest evidence available for the speaker. 
	- However, it is not because '더' marks some special sort of 'evidential meaning' or 'requirement of evidence,' but because assertion itself requires evidence. '더' sentences are also assertions.
-  Does sentences with '더' requires an additional evidence? Is there an additional requirement for evidence in '더' sentences? In these cases, both sentences require the strongest evidence(in this case, direct evidence). So, requirement of evidence caannot distinguish two sentences. 
	- But, these sentences differ in their meanings. 
	-   그런데, ‘관점성'으로는 가능함. 
	-   희중: Chung의 여러 예시들 (5,6,7,8) ‘더'를 쓴 문장들에서 ‘더'를 빼고 말해도 이상하지 않음. 
	-   두 경우 모두 발화하려면 직접 증거를 요구한다는 점에서는 동일하다. (같은 증거 상황에서 발화 가능) 
	-   하지만, 두 발화는 다르다. 어떤점에서? ‘더'가 들어가면 관점성이 개입해서 hedging이 이뤄진다. 
	-   선생-제자 대화 예시에서, 선생의 전문분야(권위가 선생한테있는)에 대해서 제자가 ‘A더라구요.’ 라고 하는것은 Acceptable한 여지가 있지만, (자신이 이런저런 관찰을 했다는 뉘앙스가 있음) 하지만 ‘A에요.' 라고 plain assertion을 하는 것은 무리가 있다.
