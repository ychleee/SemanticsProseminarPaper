# Content Summary

>[!Abstract]
Many typologically distinct languages express indirect evidentiality in their tense/aspect system. This paper studies the past tense marker -*sqa* of Cuzco Quechua which gives rise to indirect evidential interpretations. In Quechua, evidentiality is primarily expressed by a system of enclitics which specify the speaker’s type of source of information as the best possible, reportative, or conjectural. This paper argues that -*sqa* is not of the same type as these enclitics. The latter encode an evidential relation between the speaker and the proposition expressed, but -*sqa* does not. -*sqa* also not encode an epistemic relation as has been argued for similar markers of other languages. ==Instead, -*sqa* is analysed as a deictic element which locates the described eventuality outside the speaker’s perceptual field at topic time.== The evidential interpretations associated with -*sqa* arise only indirectly from this spatial meaning. The Quechua data suggest that two types of evidentiality have to be distinguished: ==propositional-level evidentiality,== which is a relation between the speaker and the proposition, and ==event-level evidentiality,== which, in the case of Quechua, is deictically induced.

## 1. INTRODUCTION
- Evidentiality narrowly defined is the linguistic coding of the speaker’s grounds for making a speech act.
- In assertions, evidentiality is the linguistic encoding of the speaker’s type of source of information.
- [[Hanks (1984)]] shows in his paper entitled ‘The Evidential Core of Deixis in Yucatec Maya’ that the deictic system of Yucatec Maya is to some extent based on evidential distinctions.
 > In this paper, I argue with reference to Cuzco Quechua (referred to in the following simply as Quechua) that the converse relationship between evidentiality and deixis also holds. The argument is developed for the Quechua past tense suffix -*sqa*, which gives rise to indirect evidential interpretations.
 
	(1) a. Para-sha-sqa. 
				rain-PROG-NX.PST
			p = ‘It was raining.’ 
			EV: sp was told/infers p 

			b. Para-sha-rqa-n. 
				rain-PROG-PST-3
			p = ‘It was raining.’  
			implicated EV: sp saw that it was raining

(1a) conveys that the speaker **either was told that it rained or that (s)he inferred that it rained based on a result of the raining event such as the streets being wet**. -sqa stands in opposition to the evidentially neutral past tense suffix -rqa. As indicated in (1b), the same sentence with -rqa implicates that the speaker has direct evidence for asserting p.
- Since -rqa does not code but only implicates an evidential value, it can often be used in the same contexts as -sqa,
- It is an interesting research question what determines the choice between the two markers in such cases. (I hypothesize that the choice between the two suffixes is determined by discourse factors, not by their truth-conditional meanings.)

> It will be argued that -sqa is **not an evidential** if evidentials are defined as operators that code a relation between the speaker and the proposition expressed. 
> > Instead, -sqa is shown to be a representative of a second type of marker which **operate on the eventuality**, and which give rise to evidential interpretations only indirectly.
> One of the main claims of the paper is that two types of evidentiality have to be distinguished: ==**propositional-** and **event-level evidentiality**==.
> > -*sqa*: a spatio-temporal deictic which specifies that the described eventuality e is not located within the speaker’s perceptual field at topic time. From this it follows that the speaker cannot have had direct evidence for e.

- That there is an intimate connection between deixis and evidentiality has also been observed by [[Hanks (1984)]] (Yucatec Maya), [[Garrett (2000)]] (Tibetan), [[Schlichter (1986)]] (Wintu), [[Levinson (to appear)]]. The ==evidentiality–deixis connection== is therefore of cross-linguistic relevance.

>[!notes] Hypotheses
> (i) the distinction between evidentiality proper and event-level evidentiality is of cross-linguistic relevance,
> (ii) that spatial deixis might be the key to understanding event-level evidentiality across languages.

- Quechua is particularly well-suited for showing that not all elements that give rise to evidential readings are necessarily genuine evidentials, since it possesses a system of proper evidentials, which consists of three enclitics for best possible, reportative and conjectural evidence (described in detail and analysed in [[Faller (2002)]])
- Through a comparison with the two indirect evidentials it will be shown that -sqa is of a different type. 
	- The evidential enclitics operate *on the embedded proposition*, specifying an evidential relation between it and the speaker, but -sqa operates *within the proposition and on the event*. 
	- -sqa conveys evidentiality only indirectly: since one can only learn about an event that took place outside one’s perceptual field by indirect means, a marker that locates an event outside one’s perceptual field, such as -sqa, will convey indirect evidentiality.
- The analysis of -sqa as a spatio-temporal deictic is couched within the framework of **event semantics**, and makes use of basic notions developed in **neo-Reichenbachian tense/aspect semantics** augmented with a spatial component.

### 1.1 The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua
I present the primary system for expressing evidential distinctions in Cuzco Quechua

	(2) a. Para-sha-n-mi. 
				rain-PROG-3-BPG
				p = ‘It is raining.’  
				EV: sp sees that it raining, 
	
			b. Para-sha-n-cha ́ . 
				rain-PROG-3-CONJ
				p = ‘It is possibly raining.’  
				EV: sp conjectures that it might be raining 
	
			c. Para-sha-n-si.  
				rain-PROG-3-REP
				p = ‘It is raining.’  
				EV: sp was told that it is raining 
	
			d. Para-sha-n.  
				rain-PROG-3
				p = ‘It is raining.’  
				implicated EV: sp sees that it is raining

In Faller (2002) the three enclitics are analysed as **illocutionary operators** which modify the basic sincerity condition associated with assertions in any language, which is that the speaker sp believes the embedded proposition p to be true, formally *Bel(sp,p)*.
- In descriptions of observable events such as (2a), -mi adds the condition that the speaker acquired knowledge of p through *direct perception*. In descriptions of events that are not observable in principle such as the feelings of another person -mi indicates that the speaker’s belief is based on ‘the next best thing’, for example, *the report of the person who experiences the feelings*. In descriptions of ‘encyclopedic’ information, that is, information acquired through teaching in the most general sense, -mi indicates that the speaker’s belief is based on *authority*. Generalizing across these cases, Faller (2002) analyses -mi as stating that the speaker has the **best possible grounds (*Bpg*)** for the described type of information.
- As indicated in (2d), sentences without an evidential enclitic convey the same evidential value as that encoded by the Direct enclitic -mi. This value, however, is not encoded by any element in the sentence, but arises as a conversational implicature (Faller 2002).

	(3) a. -mi:  ASSERT(p); SINC ={Bel(sp, p) ∧ Bpg(sp, p)} 
	b. -chá: ASSERT(p); SINC ={Bel(sp,$\lozenge$p) ∧ Rea(sp,$\lozenge$p)}  
	c. -si: PRESENT(p); SINC ={Bel(sp, q) ∧ q = ∃sp3.Say(sp3, p)}

Under this analysis, all three evidential enclitics establish **a relation between the speaker sp and the proposition p which identifies the type of source of the information conveyed**.

### 1.2 Tense in Cuzco Quechua
<u>Present</u>: 
puklla-n-ku
play-3-PL  
‘They play.’

<u>Future</u>:
puklla-nqa-ku 
play-3FUT-PL 
‘They will play.’

<u>Past</u> -rqa:
pukllan-rqa-n-ku
play-PST-3-PL
'They played'

<u>Past</u> -sqa:
pukllan-sqa-n-ku
play-NX.PST-3-PL
'They played'

The classification of -sqa as a past tense suffix will be defended in [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#4.2 The temporal meaning of -sqa|Section 4.2]] against the potential alternative of analyzing it as a perfect.

## 2. THE INTERPRETATIONS OF *-sqa*
<u>the different meanings of -sqa are described.</u>

The suffix -sqa has variously been referred to as *reportative past* (Cusihuaman 1976), as *non-experienced past* (Cerrón-Palomino 1994) and as *sudden discovery tense* (Adelaar 1977; Lefebvre & Muysken 1988). These terms, which all assume that -sqa is primarily a tense marker, capture the various non-temporal interpretations -sqa gives rise to, which will be described in this section. 
- Readers not interested in the details of the Quechua data may skip ahead.

## 3. WHAT *-sqa* IS NOT
I argue that -sqa is not an evidential proper, because it does not encode a relation between the speaker and the proposition. I also argue that it cannot be analysed as an epistemic modal as proposed by Izvorski (1997) for perfects of evidentiality.

### 3.1 Differences between -sqa and the Quechua evidential enclitics
As I will show in the following, there are some fundamental differences between -sqa and the evidential enclitics which lead to the conclusion that **-sqa is not an evidential proper**.

#### 3.1.1. *-sqa* operates on events & within the proposition
As discussed in [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#1.1 The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua|Section 1.1]], the evidential enclitics are illocutionary modifiers, that is, they are not part of the propositional content. However, -sqa’s function as a tense marker requires it to operate on events, that is, within the proposition. 
	Under the hypothesis that -sqa as an evidential is of the same type as the enclitics, we would have to assume that -sqa operates simultaneously on the propositional and the illocutionary level. This may be problematic.

#### 3.1.2. Analysis as a spatio-temporal deictic does not in and of itself impose any co-occurrence restrictions with the evidential enclitics
*A sentence can only have a single evidential value, and no evidential enclitic can co-occur with another in the same sentence.* If -sqa were an indirect evidential, we would expect the following co-occurrence restrictions: the Conjectural -chá and the Reportative -si should be able to co-occur with it, as their evidential values do not clash with that of -sqa, whereas the Direct -mi is not expected to co-occur with it. However, in actual fact we find the situation in (13).

		(13) a. Para-sha-sqa-n. 
		rain-PROG-NX.PST-BPG
		p = ‘It rained.’  
		EV: sp was told/infers from result that it rained 
	
		b. Para-sha-sqa-s.  
		rain-PROG-NX.PST-REP
		p = ‘It rained.’  
		EV: sp was told that it rained. 
		
		c. * Para-sha-sqa-chá. 
		rain-PROG-NX.PST-CONJ

*Contrary to the prediction made by the analysis of -sqa as an indirect evidential, -mi can, but -chá cannot co-occur with -sqa. This strongly suggests that -sqa is not an evidential.*
	Let me point out, however, that, in contrast to an analysis of -sqa as an indirect evidential, its analysis as a spatio-temporal deictic does not in and of itself impose any co-occurrence restrictions with the evidential enclitics

#### 3.1.3. Different behaviors in questions
-sqa behaves differently from the two indirect enclitics in questions. Given the pattern below, -sqa differs from both indirect evidential enclitics in questions.

	(14a): p-sqa-si
		EV: (i) sp assumes that addressee knows the answer from reports  
		(ii) sp asks the question on behalf of a third person
	(14b): p-rqa-chá
		EV: One can only guess what the answer might be
	(15): p-sqa
		EV: sp expects addressee to give an account of addressee's experiences

#### 3.1.4. *-sqa* only allows *de dicto* reading (no *de re/de dicto* ambiguity)
-sqa differs from the Reportative -si in that *it does not give rise to de re/de dicto ambiguities*, while -si does. This contrast is shown in (16).

	(16) a. Estados Unidos-pa rey-ni-n-**si** Peru-man hamu-**sqa**.
		United States-GEN king-EUPH-3-REP Peru-ILL come-NX.PST  
		p = ‘The king of the United States came to Peru.’
		EV = sp was told that p  
	
	b. Estados Unidos-pa rey-ni-n Peru-man hamu-**sqa**.
		United States-GEN king-EUPH-3 Peru-ILL come-NX.PST  
		p = ‘The king of the United States came to Peru.’
		EV = sp was told/infers that p

The speaker of (16a) may believe him- or herself that there is a king of the United States (de re), or (s)he may not (de dicto). However, *the speaker of (16b), in which the Reportative enclitic -si is omitted, must believe that there is a king of the United States for the assertion to be sincere*. It is well-known that the de re/de dicto ambiguity arises with belief attributions to other persons, for example in Marya believes that there is a king of the United States. In (16a) the Reportative functions like a belief predicate, albeit on the level of sincerity conditions, in that it attributes the belief that p to another person (see [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#1.1 The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua|Section 1.1]]). The fact that (16b), which contains only -sqa, does not allow the de dicto reading indicates that *it states the current speaker’s belief directly, that is, it does not specify a relation between the speaker and the proposition*.

> While none of these taken by itself forces one to conclude that -sqa is not an indirect evidential, each shows that it is at least not an evidential of the same type as the evidential enclitics, and taken together they are strong evidence for the claim that -sqa is not an evidential at all.

### 3.2 -sqa is not an epistemic modal
#### Perfect of evidentiality (PE)
[[Izvorski (1997)]] analyses the so-called **perfect of evidentiality (PE)** in a number of different languages within Kratzer’s (1987) framework of possible world semantics for modality. The following examples illustrate the PE’s of modern Turkish, (17a), and Bulgarian, (17b).

	(17) a. Ahmet gel-mi ̧s.  
	Ahmet come-mI ̧s  
	‘Ahmet came / must have come.’
(i) inference: The speaker sees Ahmet’s coat hanging in the front hall, but has not yet seen Ahmet.
(ii) hearsay: The speaker has been told that Ahmet has arrived, but has not yet seen Ahmet.
(Aksu-Koc & Slobin 1986: 159)

	b. Ivan izpil vsicˇkoto vino vcˇera. 
	Ivan drunk-PE all-the wine yesterday 
	‘Ivan apparently drank all the wine yesterday.’
(i) inference  (ii) reportative 
(Izvorski 1997: 7)

According to Izvorski, declarative sentences containing a PE have the assertive and presuppositional meaning components given in (18).

(18) 
	a. Assertion: $\square$p in view of the speaker’s knowledge state 
	b. Presupposition: Speaker has indirect evidence for p
	(Izvorski 1997: 5)

According to this analysis, the PE is essentially an epistemic necessity modal, asserting that the embedded proposition p is necessarily true with respect to the speaker’s knowledge state. It differs from regular epistemic modals in presupposing that this claim is based on indirect evidence. This presupposition restricts the kind of conversational background the PE can refer to.

#### Sentences with *-sqa* are unmodified indicative sentences.
>I argue that -sqa does not carry epistemic modal force and that it therefore cannot be analyzed as a PE in Izvorski’s (1997) sense. *A sentence with -sqa simply states a fact of the actual world, and a speaker is as committed to its truth as with any unmodified indicative sentence.* This is not the case for epistemic modal sentences. 

It is fine to assert must p and at the same time claim ignorance concerning the truth of p, as shown in (20).

	(20) Jo must have been at the meeting, but I don’t really know.

This is not possible with Quechua -sqa, just as this is not possible with the uncontroversially non-modal past tense -rqa, or an indicative in English:

	(21) # Marya hun ̃unakuy-pi ka-sha-sqa/rqa, ichaqa mana-n allin-ta yacha-ni-chu.  
		Marya meeting-LOC be-PROG-NX.PST but not-BPG good-ACC know-1-NEG  
		‘# Marya was at the meeting, but I don’t know (it) well.’

Further support for the claim that -sqa is non-modal is the observation that sentences containing -sqa (and no evidential enclitic or modal) are usually not translatable as modal statements in other languages. Thus the resultative use in (22), repeated from (5a), cannot be translated with epistemic *must* in English, or with *deber* in Spanish.

> In summary, what is asserted by a sentence with -sqa is not a relation of necessity or possibility between the speaker’s knowledge state and the proposition p, but simply p.

### 3.3 Indirectivity
#### Turkish suffix mI ̧s
The conclusions drawn for Quechua -sqa in the preceding two sections are similar to those drawn by [[Johanson (2000)]] for the Turkish suffix mI ̧s and its corresponding forms in a variety of old and modern Turkic languages. Johanson analyses these suffixes as **indirectives**. 
- These are not epistemic modals:
- They are also not evidentials:

#### The notion of distance as central to the meaning of *-sqa* 
Instead, indirectives state the narrated event ‘indirectly, by reference to its reception by a conscious participant’ and signal ‘the impression or reception of a content introduced from the outside: the very fact that it becomes obvious to P (= the speaker)’ (Johanson 2000: 71).
- As English translational equivalents of indirectives, Johanson offers *evidently*, *obviously*, *it appears that*.
- These, however, are not good translational equivalents for Quechua -sqa. Sentences with -sqa are translated as simple indicatives, without reference to how the information conveyed entered the speaker’s consciousness. 

>What -sqa shares with indirectives in Johanson’s sense is the element of distance between the speaker and the narrated event. 
>The proposal developed in the following takes the notion of *distance* as central to the meaning of -sqa, but unlike in Johanson’s account, it is not analyzed as a propositional attitude, but as *a specification of the location of the event with respect to the speaker*.

## 4. *-sqa* AS A SPATIO-TEMPORAL DEICTIC
The basis of my proposal for -sqa is that it, like other tense/aspect markers, operates *within*, not *on* the proposition, and that the somewhat vague meaning of ‘indirect evidence’ can be made precise by rephrasing it as the absence of perceptual accessibility to the eventuality e described: 
- -sqa, I claim, encodes that e is not contained within the speaker’s perceptual space at topic time.

### 4.1 Temporal relations in event semantics
#### Neo-Reichenbachian temporal semantics
In standard neo-Reichenbachian approaches tense and aspect markers are analysed as relating three temporal parameters to each other: 
- the **event time E**, i.e. the time during which an event takes place or a state holds; 
- the **reference** or **topic time R**, i.e. the time about which the assertion is made (Klein 1994),23 and *which may be overtly specified by temporal frame adverbs such as yesterday, on Sunday*; 
- the **time of speaking/utterance time S**. 

Tense markers specify the relation between R and S, and aspect markers that between E and R (Kiparsky 2002; Klein 1994).
- In the absence of overt marking, the following default relations are assumed (cf. Kiparsky 2002).
- The defaults in (23) can be overridden or made more specific by overt tense and aspect markers.

	(23) 
		a. Present time reference: S $\subseteq$ R  
		b. E $\subseteq$ R, if the eventuality is a event ($\subseteq$: Inclusion)
		c. E $\circ$ R, if the eventuality is a state ($\circ$: Overlap)

#### The framework of event semantics
The analysis of -sqa developed in the following is based on this analysis of tense and aspect embedded within the framework of event semantics
- The following ontological entities will be assumed: object individuals, eventualities e (events and states—when specific reference to states is made, the variable s is used), time intervals t, and spatial locations l. 
	- t<sub>R</sub>, t<sub>S</sub> for R and S; 
	- For E, $\tau$(e) , which ‘maps an event to its temporal trace, or ‘run time’(Krifka 1989: 97)
	- Two time intervals t1 and t2 can be related to each other by temporal inclusion, t1 $\subseteq$ t2, temporal overlap t1 $\circ$ t2 and precedence t1 ≺ t2.
- Verbal predicates have an eventuality argument in addition to their individual arguments, and basic untensed sentences (sentence radicals) denote properties of eventualities.
- Tense operators take sentence radicals as their argument and specify a particular relation between t<sub>R</sub> and t<sub>S</sub>. For simplicity, I assume that t<sub>S</sub> = now as given by the speech situation throughout this paper, and that t<sub>R</sub> is the first argument of the tense operator; t<sub>R</sub> may either be supplied by temporal frame adverbs such as yesterday or by the context. For a more elaborate compositional analysis of tense and frame adverbs see, for example, Abusch (1998) and Condoravdi (2002).
- To derive a full proposition from this property of events, I assume, following a suggestion by an anonymous reviewer, that the declarative mood DECL introduces an existential quantifier over the event variable.
- I furthermore assume that the default aspectual relations are introduced simultaneously with existential closure.

	(24) Marya run: λe.run(Marya)(e)
	(25) PAST: λtRλPλe (P(e) ∧ tR ≺ now)
	(27) DECL(PAST(this morning)(Marya run)): $\exists$e(run(Marya)(e) $\wedge$ this morning ≺ now $\wedge$ $\tau$(e) $\subseteq$ this morning)
