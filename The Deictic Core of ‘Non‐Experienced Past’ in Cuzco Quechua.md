## Abstract
Many typologically distinct languages express indirect evidentiality in their tense/aspect system. This paper studies the past tense marker -*sqa* of Cuzco Quechua which gives rise to indirect evidential interpretations. In Quechua, evidentiality is primarily expressed by a system of enclitics which specify the speaker’s type of source of information as the best possible, reportative, or conjectural. This paper argues that -*sqa* is not of the same type as these enclitics. The latter encode an evidential relation between the speaker and the proposition expressed, but -*sqa* does not. -*sqa* also not encode an epistemic relation as has been argued for similar markers of other languages. ==Instead, -*sqa* is analysed as a deictic element which locates the described eventuality outside the speaker’s perceptual field at topic time.== The evidential interpretations associated with -*sqa* arise only indirectly from this spatial meaning. The Quechua data suggest that two types of evidentiality have to be distinguished: ==propositional-level evidentiality,== which is a relation between the speaker and the proposition, and ==event-level evidentiality,== which, in the case of Quechua, is deictically induced.

## 1. INTRODUCTION
- Evidentiality narrowly defined is the linguistic coding of the speaker’s grounds for making a speech act.
- In assertions, evidentiality is the linguistic encoding of the speaker’s type of source of information.
- [[Hanks (1984)]] shows in his paper entitled ‘The Evidential Core of Deixis in Yucatec Maya’ that the deictic system of Yucatec Maya is to some extent based on evidential distinctions.
 > In this paper, I argue with reference to Cuzco Quechua (referred to in the following simply as Quechua) that the converse relationship between evidentiality and deixis also holds. The argument is developed for the Quechua past tense suffix -*sqa*, which gives rise to indirect evidential interpretations.
 
	(1) a. Para-sha-sqa. 
				rain-PROG-NX.PST
			p = ‘It was raining.’ 
			EV: sp was told/infers p 

			b. Para-sha-rqa-n. 
				rain-PROG-PST-3
			p = ‘It was raining.’  
			implicated EV: sp saw that it was raining

(1a) conveys that the speaker **either was told that it rained or that (s)he inferred that it rained based on a result of the raining event such as the streets being wet**. -sqa stands in opposition to the evidentially neutral past tense suffix -rqa. As indicated in (1b), the same sentence with -rqa implicates that the speaker has direct evidence for asserting p.
- Since -rqa does not code but only implicates an evidential value,2 it can often be used in the same contexts as -sqa,
- It is an interesting research question what determines the choice between the two markers in such cases. (I hypothesize that the choice between the two suffixes is determined by discourse factors, not by their truth-conditional meanings.)

> It will be argued that -sqa is **not an evidential** if evidentials are defined as operators that code a relation between the speaker and the proposition expressed. 
> > Instead, -sqa is shown to be a representative of a second type of marker which **operate on the eventuality**, and which give rise to evidential interpretations only indirectly.
> One of the main claims of the paper is that two types of evidentiality have to be distinguished: ==**propositional- and event-level evidentiality**==.
> > -*sqa*: a spatio-temporal deictic which specifies that the described eventuality e is not located within the speaker’s perceptual field at topic time. From this it follows that the speaker cannot have had direct evidence for e.

- That there is an intimate connection between deixis and evidentiality has also been observed by [[Hanks (1984)]] (Yucatec Maya), [[Garrett (2000)]] (Tibetan), [[Schlichter (1986)]] (Wintu), [[Levinson (to appear)]]. The ==evidentiality–deixis connection== is therefore of cross-linguistic relevance.

>[!notes] Hypotheses
> (i) the distinction between evidentiality proper and event-level evidentiality is of cross-linguistic relevance,
> (ii) that spatial deixis might be the key to understanding event-level evidentiality across languages.

- Quechua is particularly well-suited for showing that not all elements that give rise to evidential readings are necessarily genuine evidentials, since it possesses a system of proper evidentials, which consists of three enclitics for best possible, reportative and conjectural evidence (described in detail and analysed in [[Faller (2002)]])
- Through a comparison with the two indirect evidentials it will be shown that -sqa is of a different type. 
	- The evidential enclitics operate *on the embedded proposition*, specifying an evidential relation between it and the speaker, but -sqa operates *within the proposition and on the event*. 
	- -sqa conveys evidentiality only indirectly: since one can only learn about an event that took place outside one’s perceptual field by indirect means, a marker that locates an event outside one’s perceptual field, such as -sqa, will convey indirect evidentiality.
- The analysis of -sqa as a spatio-temporal deictic is couched within the framework of **event semantics**, and makes use of basic notions developed in **neo-Reichenbachian tense/aspect semantics** augmented with a spatial component.

### 1.1 The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua
I present the primary system for expressing evidential distinctions in Cuzco Quechua

	(2) a. Para-sha-n-mi. 
				rain-PROG-3-BPG
				p = ‘It is raining.’  
				EV: sp sees that it raining, 
	
			b. Para-sha-n-cha ́ . 
				rain-PROG-3-CONJ
				p = ‘It is possibly raining.’  
				EV: sp conjectures that it might be raining 
	
			c. Para-sha-n-si.  
				rain-PROG-3-REP
				p = ‘It is raining.’  
				EV: sp was told that it is raining 
	
			d. Para-sha-n.  
				rain-PROG-3
				p = ‘It is raining.’  
				implicated EV: sp sees that it is raining

In Faller (2002) the three enclitics are analysed as  **illocutionary operators** which modify the basic sincerity condition associated with assertions in any language, which is that the speaker sp believes the embedded proposition p to be true, formally *Bel(sp,p)*.
- As indicated in (2d), sentences without an evidential enclitic convey the same evidential value as that encoded by the Direct enclitic -mi. This value, however, is not encoded by any element in the sentence, but arises as a conversational implicature (Faller 2002).

(3) a. -mi:  ASSERT(p); SINC ={Bel(sp, p) ∧ Bpg(sp, p)} 
			b. -chá: ASSERT(p); SINC ={Bel(sp,♦p) ∧ Rea(sp,♦p)}  
			c. -si: PRESENT(p); SINC ={Bel(sp, q) ∧ q = ∃sp3.Say(sp3, p)}


### 1.2 Tense in Cuzco Quechua

## 2. THE INTERPRETATIONS OF *-sqa*
the different meanings of -sqa are described.

## 3. WHAT *-sqa*- IS NOT
I argue that -sqa is not an evidential proper, because it does not encode a relation between the speaker and the proposition. I also argue that it cannot be analysed as an epistemic modal as proposed by Izvorski (1997) for perfects of evidentiality.

### 3.1 Differences between -sqa and the Quechua evidential enclitics
### 3.2 -sqa is not an epistemic modal
### 3.3 Indirectivity

## 4. *-sqa*- AS A SPATIO-TEMPORAL DEICTIC
### 4.1 Temporal relations in event semantics
### 4.2 The temporal meaning of -sqa
### 4.3 The spatial meaning component of -sqa

## 5. THE EVIDENTIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF *-sqa*-

## 6. *-sqa*- AND DIRECT EVIDENCE
how the proposed analysis accounts for uses of -sqa in situations in which the speaker has direct evidence for part of the eventuality described.

## 7. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
