## Why plain assertion requires the strongest evidence. 

### Griciean Maxim of Quality
One should assert things only when one has appropriate evidence.

###### GMQ'(Gricean Maxim of Quality'): An assertion's strength should match the evidence's strength. (The assertion's strength must be proportional to one's evidence's strength. )
- In order to assert more strongly, one needs stronger evidence.

Context 1: There was a murder in John's neighborhood. Bill was killed. John knows that Tom, who lives next to Bill was in town when Bill was killed, and he is very violent, and he hates Bill. John talks to his friend when talking about the accident: 

data:: # Tom is the murderer. 톰이 살인자야. 
data:: # Tom must be the murderer. 톰이 살인자인게 분명해.
data:: (#) Tom probably would be the murderer. 톰이 아마 살인자일거야.
data::  Tom might be the murderer. 톰이 살인자일수도 있어. 

Context 2: Evidence increased: John came to know that Bill and Tom had a heavy fight the day before. And Tom then bought a gun at a local store.

data:: # Tom is the murderer. 톰이 살인자야.
data:: # Tom must be the murderer. 톰이 살인자인게 분명해.
data:: Tom probably would be the murderer. 톰이 아마 살인자일거야.
data:: (#) Tom might be the murderer. 톰이 살인자일수도 있어. 

Context 3: Evidence increased: John came to know that Tom died by a gun shot, and the type of bullet by which he was killed exactly matches the type of bullet Bill bought the day before. 

data:: # Tom is the murderer. 톰이 살인자야.
data:: Tom must be the murderer. 톰이 살인자인게 분명해.
data:: (#)Tom probably would be the murderer. 톰이 아마 살인자일거야.
data:: # Tom might be the murderer.톰이 살인자일수도 있어. 

Context 4: Evidence increased: I saw CCTV that filmed Bill shooting a gun to Tom. 

data:: Tom is the murderer. 톰이 살인자야.
data:: # Tom must be the murderer. 톰이 살인자인게 분명해.
data:: # Tom probably would be the murderer. 톰이 아마 살인자일거야.
data:: # Tom might be the murderer.톰이 살인자일수도 있어. 

#### Explanation why plain assertion requires the strongest evidence. 

##### Plain assertion is the strongest assertion. 
- Kartunnen's puzzle.
	- It is at least more stronger than necessity epistemic modal.

By [[#GMQ|GMQ']], plain assertion requires the strongest evidence.

'더' => plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences []) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on. 

Plain assertion without any additional morphemes(markers/ intuitively, 'hedging' markers) already has the strongest requirement for evidentiaity. In order to say plain assertive sentences, the speaker ias required to have the strongest type of evidences. In this sense, propositional level eventuality is already inherent in plain assertion. 

## Is Perception agential?
#### Intentionality test
- I intentionally saw that.
	- Perception itself is passive
	- But 
- I intentionally heard those musics.  => Not infellicitous
	- 
- I saw that.

Voluntary 한 Point

16a, b
보다, 듣다, 
=> Passive 한 perception 이 아니라 Active한 행위를 나타내는 동사들인듯.
'intentionally'
=> 테스트 다 통과. 



'duration, frequency'

한국어 '보다', '듣다' 등의 동사들은 전부 다 행위 동사인듯. Passive한 동사가 아니다. 타동사. 
=> 보더라 듣더라 안됨. 
=> Passivity를 표현할 수 있다. 보이다 들리다. 
=> 일부로 보다 도 됨.

근데 그거는 영어도 마찬가지 아닌가? I saw that. 
영어는 애매한듯. I saw him intentionally. 


## Thesis 1: What -te- is not

Instead, we propose that -te- is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies the perspective from which the assertion is based. This perspective can be a physical location, a point in time, or a combination of both. The addition of -te- to a sentence serves to specify the vantage point from which the assertion is made, rather than adding any additional evidential requirement.

Consider the example provided above. In this scenario, John's assertion "톰이 빌을 쐈더라" is based on his sensory observations and investigation


- Lee (2013) analyzes -te- as a necessity modal. But we argue that it is not. Below is Lee's lexical antry for -te- 
data:: 22 $[[-te]] = \lambda P_{<s,<i,t>>}.\lambda w.\lambda t. \exists t''[t''<t \land \forall w'[w' \in BEST(SO,ST/DX, w, t'') \rightarrow P(w')(t''))]]$
We argue that this lexical entry faces difficulty in explaining data like below: 
	- Context: There was a murder in the neighborhood of John: Bill was murdered by someone. John is a close friend to Bill. He lives the next door and he is one of the officials who investigated the incident. John saw that Bill and Tom fought heavily the day before the murder. (Tom said "I will kill you.") And he saw that Tom buying a gun and bullets right after the fight. What he also saw was Tom going toward the direction to Bill's house on the day of the murder. And by investigating the situation, he found out that the type of bullet that Tom bought the day before the murder was the same kind of bullet that Bill had been shot. The next day of the murder, John talks to his officer friend about the murder.
1. In this situation, John can felicitoulsy assert the necessity epistemic modal: "톰이 빌을 쏜 것이 틀림없어" (It must be the case that Tom shoot Bill.)
2. But, John cannot felicitously assert -te- sentence: "톰이 빌을 쐈더라." ([It is observed by the speaker] Tom shoot Bill.)
3. But by if we follow Lee (2013)'s analysis of *-te-* and take lexical entry of $[[-te-]]$ in 22, John can fellicitously assert that "톰이 빌을 쐈더라."
	- It is because given his sensory observations of evidences(modal base) and stereotypical/doxastic ordering source, the proposition that Tom shoot Bill is true in all epistemic alternative worlds for John. 




## Thesis 1: -te- is not an evidential marker
We argue that -te- is not an evidential marker. Our perspective diverges from the mainstream views in previous studies, notably Lee (2013) and Lim (2010) who argue that -te- is a morpheme that marks evidentiality. 

Instead, we propose that -te- is a deictic tense that denotes an EAT (Evidence Acquisition Time) that is prior to ST (Speech Time). This EAT is an evidential perspective from which the speaker observed (directly perceived) the situation in RT (Reference Time). In other words, it denotes a perspective in a certain past time from which the speaker perceived the situation.

In this respect, our account is similar to Chung (2007)'s account.  Chung also argues that -te- is not an evidential marker. Instead, Chung proposed that morphemes like -ass- or -kyess-, or ø, when appeared in -te- sentences, play the role of evidential marker that contributes the meaning of evidentiality to -te- sentences. Morphemes like -ass- or -kyess- are tense morphemes in other contexts, but with -te-, they become evidentials. This ambiguity thesis of Korean tense morphemes, however, has faced serious objections, as we have seen in previous chapters. It is neither independently motivated nor correctly predicts indirect/direct distinctions. 

We acknowledge that there is a propositional-level evidentiality in -te- assertive sentences, in that the speaker must have an appropriate level of evidence in order to felicitously assert the -te- sentence. However, we argue that this evidential element is not added by '-te-', as Lee and Lim argued, or by '-ass-,' 'kyess,' or ø, as in Chung's account. Instead, we argue that this evidentiality is the result of conversational implicature of assertion, not something that is contributed by an evidential marker
To show this, we will argue that plain assertive Korean sentences without -te-, still exhibits the propositional level evidentiality. In fact, in the same context, there is no difference in evidential requirement for the speaker concerning evidence types with plain assertions and -te- assertions. They both require the strongest type of evidence: observational evidence. 

>Observation and Extended Observation 

But before we go further, let us briefly specify the sense of 'observational evidence' we use in this paper. Basically, what we mean by 'observation' of something, (let us say, for conversation's sake, here the object of our perception is an event), is the direct observation of the event itself.  To narrow down the extension, this will only include the direct observation of the event with our own senses. In this narrow sense, we directly observe an event only if its trace (spatio-temporal trace of an event, let us call it 'e-trace', following faller.) overlaps with our perceptual trace. However, we are using this term 'observation' more widely, to include cases what we call 'extended observation.' And we argue it there is good reason for this usage.
The case of extended observations include direct sensory observation of course, but it also includes observation of an event through highly credible means. For instance, we cannot directly sense electrons, but we can observe electrons through electron microscope. To take another example, though we cannot directly perceive a red dwarf star with our own eyes, but we can observe it through telescope. Though they are not directly observed by our naked eyes, so, they might not be an observation in a narrow sense, we observed those in a wider sense, in that we observed with a very credible mean. This is clearly different from inferring from a known data that there should be a celestrial body with a huge mass (such as black hall) in some place before directly observing it with a telescope. A CCTV is another example. We can observe an event in the past whose trace does not overlap with our (narrow) perceptual trace through CCTV.  Moreover, our notion of 'extended observation' can include cases like the observation of event through news (provided they are credible enough sources.) 
While there is a room to be flesehd out in our working definition of 'extended observation.' What it can do is to distinguish these 'extended observation' cases from inference cases. Getting to know something by inference means that one did not observed the event itself, even in the extended sense. 

So, in saying that both plain assertions and -te- assertions requires observational evidence, what we're saying is that they require the observation of an event, or situation in this 'extended' sense. And we argue it that this evidential requirement comes from conversational implicature of the assertive act.

>The propositional-level evidentiality is already present in assertions without -te-.

Our argument that -te- is not an evidential marker is that it does not contribute evidential meaning to a plain assertion. In most cases, if we delete -te- from -te- assertion to get plain assertion, the evidential requirement still remains. Let us consider the murder cases again.

context 1: (John did not observed the murder scene) John is saying to his friend.
1a."톰이 빌을 쏜 것이 틀림없어." It must be the case that Tom shoot Bill.
1b.  \#"톰이 빌을 쐈더라." [the speaker observed that] Tom shoot Bill.
1c.  \#"톰이 빌을 쐈어." Tom shoot Bill.

context 2: (John observed the murder scene) John is saying to his friend,
2a. \# "톰이 빌을 쏜 것이 틀림없어." It must be the case that Tom shoot Bill.
2b. "톰이 빌을 쐈더라." [The speaker observed that] Tom shoot Bill
2c. "톰이 빌을 쐈어." Tom shoot Bill

Now, we can see that both in plain assertions and -te- assertions are infellicitous in context 1, in which John did not observe the event himself, and fellicitous in context 2, in which John observed the event. This suggest that the evidential requirement is not gone in plain assertions, and they are incompatible with inference context. We can see that the same type of evidential requirement remains in plain assertions without -te-. This shows that this evidential requirement is not added by -te-, contra Lee (2013), and Lim (2011). 
We can fine-tune this argument against Chung(2006), who arguest that the evidentiality is encoded by -kyess-, 'ess', ø, when used with -te-. It is because according to Chung's argument, -kyess-, 'ess', or ø when occured in plain sentences without -te- is not an evidential marker. (Hence they are ambiguous.) So we can expect that sentences with only -kyess-, 'ess', or ø without -te- would not exhibit evidentiality. But this is not so, because 2c, plain assertion also exhibits same type of evidential requirement for the speaker as 2b, -te- assertion.  

Therefore, we argue that in Korean assertive sentences, this evidnetial requirement is already present in plain assertions without -te-. So, -te- is not an evidential marker. And also, -kyess-, 'ess', ø in -te- sentences is not an evidential marker, because evidential requirement is not gone when we subtract -te- from -te- assertions with those morphemes. 




This also shows that, contra Chung (2006), the evidential requirement is not what is added by -kyess-, 'ess', ø, used with -te-, because there is 



on which the assertion's evidence is based on. 
So, sentences with -te- has evidential requirements (the speaker of the sentence must have an appropriate evidence in order to felicitously speak that sentence), but this requirement does not come from any morphemes or evidential markers. Instead we will argue that it comes from the assertion itself. To make aplain assertion without any morphemes, we already must have a very good evidence. 

Plain assertion is the strongest assertion. 
- Kartoonnen's puzzle shows that it is at least more stronger than necessity epistemic modal.

Griciean Maxim of Quality
One should assert things only when one has appropriate evidence.

GMQ'(Gricean Maxim of Quality'): An assertion's strength should match the evidence's strength. (The assertion's strength must be proportional to one's evidence's strength. )
- In order to assert more strongly, one needs stronger evidence.

By Gricean Maxim of quality, and the fact that plain assetion is the strongest, plain assertion requires the strongest evidence.


-te-: plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on. 



(In summary, we reject the idea that -te- is a morpheme that marks propositional-level evidentiality. Instead, we propose that -te- is a deictic tense that denotes an EAT, or an evidential perspective from which the speaker perceived the situation in RT. We also reject the ambiguity thesis of Korean tense morphemes and argue that the propositional-level evidentiality in -te- sentences is a result of conversational implicature of assertion.)
###### Ingredients
- Lee and Lim both argue that *-te-* is a morpheme that marks a propositional-level evidentiality, which is a relation between speaker and the proposition. 
- We argue that it is not. We argue that *-te-* is a deictic tense that denotes an EAT (Evience Acquisition Time) that is prior to ST (speech time). and that EAT is an evidential perspective from which the speaker observed (directly perceived) the situation in RT (Reference Time). In other words, it denotes a perspective in a certain past time from which the speaker perceived the situation. 
- In this respect, our account resembles Chung (2007)'s account. (We take sides with Chung in this issue.) Chung argues that in -te- sentences, -te- is not an evidential marker. Instead, she proposed that -ass- or -kyess-, or ø plays the role of evidential marker that contributes the meaning of evidentiality to -te- sentences. Morphemes like -ass- or -kyess- are tense morphemes in other contexts, but with -te-, they become evidentials. (So Chung is arguning that they are ambiguous.) With -te-, -ass- or -kyess- exhibit indirect evidential meaning, while ø exhibits direct evidential meaning. 
- As we have seen in the previous chapter, this proposal faced serious objections. This ambiguity thesis of korean tense morpheme is neither independently motivated nor correctly predicts indirect/ direct distinctions. 
- There is a propositional-level evidentiality in *-te-* assertive sentences, in that the speaker must have an appropriate level of evidence in order to felicitously assert the *-te-* sentence. But we argue that the evidential element is not what is added by '-te-.' (Or by '-ass-,' 'kyess', ø in ) We are also against this ambuiguity thesis. 
- If not -te-, and also not in '-ass-', 'kyess,' where to locate this evidential meaning in -te- sentences? We argue that in fact, there is no morpheme in Korean -te- sentences that encodes this propositional evidentiality, (which is the relation between a proposition and a speaker). But we are not denying that Korean -te- sentences exhibit propositional evidentiality in that it is required for the speaker of the sentence to have an appropriate type of evidence in order to felicitously assert -te- sentences. But we argue that this evdidentiality is the result of conversational implicature of assertion, not something that is contributed by a morpheme. 


## Thesis (3) -te- sentences as expressing an assertion made from a perspective (EAT). 
- We argue that -te- sentences are assertive sentences made from a perspective (EAT). 
- To illustrate this, we will start with simple cases. We will divide cases into three.
1. 어제 비가 오더라. 
2. 지금 비가 오더라.
3. 내일 비가 오더라. 
- 1 asserts that 

### Time talk
- presupposed meaning of the 'EAT': EAT < ST
- Usual neo-Reichenbachian time ontology: ET <-> RT <-> ST
	- RT is unspecified when aspect is morphologically invisible
## Thesis (3) Evidentiality without "evidentials"
- How we differ from Lee or Chung's account

---

EAT는 RT에 대한 증거적 관점.

---

> 더 sentences and normal sentences isn't differentiated in terms of requirement of evidences
### the meaning of '더': ("It(the event) was observed (by the speaker) )that"
- the meaning of '네': "It is observed that"
#### Observation here means direct perception, or something near enough
##### In paradigm cases, Observation means direct perception(sensory perception is the paradigm case of observation)
###### Case 1
1. 아까 비가 오더라.
	- (It was observed (by the speaker)) that it rained then.
2.  아까 비가 왔다.
	- It rained then.
- 1 requires direct direct sensory perception. 

##### Observation isn't restricted to sensory observation (Contra Lee)
1. 그때는 욕심이 나더라. 
2. 그때 좋은 생각이 났다. 
##### Observation Can't be determined by degree of certainty 
1. 그때 내가 좋은 생각이 났다. (felicitous)
2. # 그때 내가 계획을 짜고 있더라. (infelicitous)
- 1, 2 has no difference in terms of certainty. They are both certain to the speaker. But 1 is acceptable while 2 is not. We need some other criterion.
- evidentiality of '더' is not reducible to degree of certainty (contra Lee)

##### Something Near enough: Two hypothesis: 
>1. Best possible evidendence hypothesis
> >One can use '더' if one had best possible evidence available at EAT.
> >해당 맥락에서 가장 강한 증거. 

> 2. Extended observation hypothesis 
> > One can use '더' if one observed the event (including 'extended' sense of observation) at EAT.
> > - Extended observation? ==perceived through highly credible source. ==

##### Testing the hypothesis
###### Case 2: Evidence change (Weather Forecast)
- 맥락: 오늘(10일) 오전에 내일(11일) 비가 온다는 일기예보를 보고, 점심을 먹다가 상대방에게 내일 날씨에 대해서 얘기하는 상황. 
1. 내일 아침에 비가 오더라. (felicitous)
	- (It was observed (by the speaker)) that it will rain tommorow morning .
2. 내일 아침에 비와. (felicitous)
	1. It will rain tommorow morning.
- 맥락: 11일 오후가 되었음. 늦잠자고 일어남. 실내에 있었기 때문에 비가 온 것은 관찰하지 못함. 그 상태에서 옆 사람에게 아침 날씨에 대해 얘기하는 상황. 
3. 아까 아침에 비가 오더라.  (Infelicitous)
4. 아까 아침에 비 온 것 같던데. (Infellicitous)
5. 아까 아침에 비 온 것 같아. (Infellicitious)
6. 아까 아침에 비 왔을지도 몰라. (Fellicitous)

>Question: Why is 3,4,5 infellicitous? while 6 is fellicitous?
- Evidence based on weather forcast became a fairly weak evidence on 11. So, it is only compatible with very weak form of assertion such as 6.
- What had been considered as 'direct observation or something near enough' at one context 

###### Case 3: Evidence change (News) 
> Best Evidence Hypothesis: One can use '더' if one had best possible evidence available 
- 맥락: 내일(11일) 오전에 바이든이 서울에 온다는 뉴스를 오늘(10일) 오전에 들었고, 오늘(10일) 점심을 먹다가 동료에게 얘기하는 상황.
7. 내일 바이든이 서울에 와. (felicitous)
	- (It is observed (by the speaker)) that Biden will come to Seoul tommorow.
8. 내일 바이든이 서울에 오더라. (felicitous)
	1. Biden will come to Seoul tommorow. 
- 맥락: 11일 저녁이 되었음. 실제로 바이든이 왔는지는 보지 못했음. 동료에게 얘기하는 상황. 
9. 바이든 서울 왔더라. (infellicitous)
10. 바이든 서울 왔어. (==infellicitous?==)
- 맥락: 조금 다른 상황. 11일 오후에 바이든이 무사히 서울에 도착했다는 뉴스를 보았음. 동료에게 얘기하는 상황. 
11. 바이든 서울 서울 왔더라. (felicitous)
12. 바이든 서울 왔어. (felicitous)
> Question: why 9, 10 is infellicitous while 7 and 8 is fellicitous?
> > Best possible evidence available hypothesis can explain this case. 

> Question: Why 11 and 12 is fellicitous while 9 and 10 is infellicitous? 
> > "Best possible evidence available hypothesis" fails here. 
##### The difference between 1 and 2
1. 비가왔다.
	- It rained.
2. 비가오더라. 
	- (It was observed (by the speaker) that) it rained.
> The difference between 1 and 2: 


#### What can be observed and what cannot be observed: Anscomb
- how do we understand 'perspective'
	- The first person case
- How this proposal differs from previous accounts
	- Chung's
	- Lee's
	- Lim's
- How this proposal meets desiderata for '-te' 

### Evidentiality of '더'
> [!note] There is no difference between '더' sentence and plain assertion in terms of requirement for direct evidence.
> > 'perspective' can. 
- It is true that 더' sentences require evidence. The strongest evidence available for the speaker. 
	- However, it is not because '더' marks some special sort of 'evidential meaning' or 'requirement of evidence,' but because assertion itself requires evidence. '더' sentences are also assertions.
-  Does sentences with '더' requires an additional evidence? Is there an additional requirement for evidence in '더' sentences? In these cases, both sentences require the strongest evidence(in this case, direct evidence). So, requirement of evidence caannot distinguish two sentences. 
	- But, these sentences differ in their meanings. 
	-   그런데, ‘관점성'으로는 가능함. 
	-   희중: Chung의 여러 예시들 (5,6,7,8) ‘더'를 쓴 문장들에서 ‘더'를 빼고 말해도 이상하지 않음. 
	-   두 경우 모두 발화하려면 직접 증거를 요구한다는 점에서는 동일하다. (같은 증거 상황에서 발화 가능) 
	-   하지만, 두 발화는 다르다. 어떤점에서? ‘더'가 들어가면 관점성이 개입해서 hedging이 이뤄진다. 
	-   선생-제자 대화 예시에서, 선생의 전문분야(권위가 선생한테있는)에 대해서 제자가 ‘A더라구요.’ 라고 하는것은 Acceptable한 여지가 있지만, (자신이 이런저런 관찰을 했다는 뉘앙스가 있음) 하지만 ‘A에요.' 라고 plain assertion을 하는 것은 무리가 있다. 
    
-   Reverse cases

-   “선생님, 이거 못하겠어요/못하겠네요(자기 일이 아닌 것처럼, active participant가 아닌 것처럼/유체이탈 화법)”

## Abstract Ingredients
###### Draft
In this paper, we propose a new understanding of the Korean "-te-" marker in assertive sentences. Our perspective diverges from previous studies by Lee (2010, 2013) and Lim (2010), who suggest that "-te-" is an evidential marker. Instead, we align with Chung's (2007) argument that "-te-" is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies the perspective on which the assertion is based. However, we differentiate from Chung by denying that morphemes such as "-ass-," "-kyess-," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences. We will argue that in Korean -te- assertive sentences, there is no evidential morpheme that marks [[The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua#^71d4a3|propositional level eventuality]]^[Faller (2004), "The Deictic Core of ‘Non‐Experienced Past’ in Cuzco Quechua"], which is a relation between speaker and the proposition. We will argue that this propositional-level evidentiality of -te- assertions comes from [[Supplementary Material for Semantics Term Paper#Plain assertion is the strongest assertion.|conversational implicature ]] of assertive sentences. So, -te- sentences do not need additional marker for propositional-level evidentiality. The role of "-te-" is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion's evidence is based on.
We will show that our account can comprehensively explain the datas presented in Lee, Lim and Chung and does not meet the problems their accounts faced. 

, and the requirement for evidence in "-te-" sentences is that of the plain assertion made from the specified vantage point. We will argue that our account will comprehensively explain the all the datas that -te-.

C:: The intuitive idea behind it, 

Plain assertion without any additional morphemes(markers/ intuitively, 'hedging' markers) already has the strongest requirement for evidentiality. In order to say plain assertive sentences, the speaker is required to have the strongest type of evidences. In this sense, propositional level eventuality is already inherent in plain assertion. 

**In asserting with *-te-*, we assert that an event obains (is true)**, and we are basing our/that assertion on the 'observation' we made at a given vantage point 

> We propose to understand -te- assertive sentences as assertive sentences whose 

The assertion with *-te-* is simply a plain assertion based on a specific vantage point made salient by the *-te-* marker. Therefore, it already possesses the requirement for evidentiality inherent in plain assertions, and does not require any additional marker for evidentiality.

###### Draft
In this paper, we present a novel account of the function of the Korean morpheme "-te-"  in assertive sentences. Our approach diverges from previous studies Lee (2010, 2013), and Lim (2010), who argue that there are ""-te-evidential marker in korean "-te-" sentences. Instead, we propose that 
"-te-" is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies the perspective from which the assertion is based. We argue that the requirement for evidentiality is already inherent in the plain assertion, and that the addition of "-te-" does not add any additional evidential requirement. Our positive account is that "-te-" serves to specify the vantage point on which the assertion is based, rather than adding any evidential requirement. We also reject the idea that morphemes such as "ass," "kyess," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences.

We argue that -te- sentence is a version of the plain assertion. Assertion with '-te-' is just the plain assertion whose evidence is based on specific vantage point that is made salient by '-te-.' So, it has the requirement for evidentiality that is already inherent in the plain assertion. Thus it does not need any additional marker for the requirement of evidence.   "-te-"'s role is to specify the vantage point on which the assertion is based, and the requirement for the evidence for the '-te-' sentence is that of the plain assertion made on the vantage point. 

rather than adding any evidential requirement. We also reject the idea that morphemes such as "ass," "kyess," and "ø" are evidential markers in "-te-" sentences.
###### Ingredients: GMQ

In this paper, we review Chung (2007) and Lee (2010, 2013) and Lim (2010)'s account of Korean -te- sentences. And we will present a different account about '-te-' sentences and their evidentiality. We will follow Chung (2007), in arguing that -te- is not an evidential marker. But we will present a different account from Chung (2007) in that we will argue that Korean assertive sentences with '-te-' do not need an additional 'evidential marker' to add requirement for evidentiality.
We will also argue that -te- is a spatio-temporal deictic tense that signifies a perspective that assertion's evidence is based on, following chung (2007), but will deny that morphemes like 'ass,' 'kyess,' ø are evidential markers in -te- sentences. 
Our positive account is that -te- sentences do not need evidential marker that signifies the evidence requirement, because it inherits the strongest requirement for evidence from the plain assertion. 
-te-: plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on. 


on which the assertion's evidence is based on. 
So, sentences with -te- has evidential requirements (the speaker of the sentence must have an appropriate evidence in order to felicitously speak that sentence), but this requirement does not come from any morphemes or evidential markers. Instead we will argue that it comes from the assertion itself. To make aplain assertion without any morphemes, we already must have a very good evidence. 

Plain assertion is the strongest assertion. 
- Kartoonnen's puzzle shows that it is at least more stronger than necessity epistemic modal.

Griciean Maxim of Quality
One should assert things only when one has appropriate evidence.

GMQ'(Gricean Maxim of Quality'): An assertion's strength should match the evidence's strength. (The assertion's strength must be proportional to one's evidence's strength. )
- In order to assert more strongly, one needs stronger evidence.

By Gricean Maxim of quality, and the fact that plain assetion is the strongest, plain assertion requires the strongest evidence.


-te-: plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on.

- Our account of '-te-': It is not itself an evidential.
