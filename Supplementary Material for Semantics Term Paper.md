## Why plain assertion requires the strongest evidence. 

### Griciean Maxim of Quality
One should assert things only when one has appropriate evidence.

###### GMQ'(Gricean Maxim of Quality'): An assertion's strength should match the evidence's strength. (The assertion's strength must be proportional to one's evidence's strength. )
- In order to assert more strongly, one needs stronger evidence.

Context 1: There was a murder in John's neighborhood. Bill was killed. John knows that Tom, who lives next to Bill was in town when Bill was killed, and he is very violent, and he hates Bill. John talks to his friend when talking about the accident: 

data:: # Tom is the murderer. 톰이 살인자야. 
data:: # Tom must be the murderer. 톰이 살인자인게 분명해.
data:: (#) Tom probably would be the murderer. 톰이 아마 살인자일거야.
data::  Tom might be the murderer. 톰이 살인자일수도 있어. 

Context 2: Evidence increased: John came to know that Bill and Tom had a heavy fight the day before. And Tom then bought a gun at a local store.

data:: # Tom is the murderer. 톰이 살인자야.
data:: # Tom must be the murderer. 톰이 살인자인게 분명해.
data:: Tom probably would be the murderer. 톰이 아마 살인자일거야.
data:: (#) Tom might be the murderer. 톰이 살인자일수도 있어. 

Context 3: Evidence increased: John came to know that Tom died by a gun shot, and the type of bullet by which he was killed exactly matches the type of bullet Bill bought the day before. 

data:: # Tom is the murderer. 톰이 살인자야.
data:: Tom must be the murderer. 톰이 살인자인게 분명해.
data:: (#)Tom probably would be the murderer. 톰이 아마 살인자일거야.
data:: # Tom might be the murderer.톰이 살인자일수도 있어. 

Context 4: Evidence increased: I saw CCTV that filmed Bill shooting a gun to Tom. 

data:: Tom is the murderer. 톰이 살인자야.
data:: # Tom must be the murderer. 톰이 살인자인게 분명해.
data:: # Tom probably would be the murderer. 톰이 아마 살인자일거야.
data:: # Tom might be the murderer.톰이 살인자일수도 있어. 

#### Explanation why plain assertion requires the strongest evidence. 

##### Plain assertion is the strongest assertion. 
- Kartunnen's puzzle.
	- It is at least more stronger than necessity epistemic modal.

By [[#GMQ|GMQ']], plain assertion requires the strongest evidence.

'더' => plain assertion based on a certain vintage point. (perspective.)
- It inherits(has) the requirement of the evidence of plain assertion. Only the vantage point that the assertion is based on is specified by -te- in -te- sentences.
- In this sense, (when we add -te- to plain assertive sentences []) -te- does not add any evidential requirement. The evidential requirement is already in the plain assertion. It specifies the vantage point on which the assertion is based on. 

## Is Perception agential?
#### Intentionality test
- I intentionally saw that.
	- Perception itself is passive
	- But 
- I intentionally heard those musics.  => Not infellicitous
	- 
- I saw that.

Voluntary 한 Point

16a, b
보다, 듣다, 
=> Passive 한 perception 이 아니라 Active한 행위를 나타내는 동사들인듯.
'intentionally'
=> 테스트 다 통과. 



'duration, frequency'
=> '두시간 동안'


한국어 '보다', '듣다' 등의 동사들은 전부 다 행위 동사인듯. Passive한 동사가 아니다. 타동사. 
=> 보더라 듣더라 안됨. 
=> Passivity를 표현할 수 있다. 보이다 들리다. 
=> 일부로 보다 도 됨. 
=> 

근데 그거는 영어도 마찬가지 아닌가? I saw that. 
영어는 애매한듯. I saw him intentionally.
